ACT 1.

SCENE.—Miss Woffington's Dressing-room in Drury Lane Theatre. Doors 2 E. L. H. and O. Toilet and cheval glass, R. H. Sofas, tables, chairs, <fcc., dx. FRIZZ discovered dressing a wig, R. C. MRS. WILLET arranging a dress, L. O., and a lady's hoop which is on a stand, L.

Frizz: There, Mrs. Willet, what a sensation that wig will make tonight; is not that curl a round of applause?

Willet: Observe this silver tissue, Mr. Frizz.

Frizz: What’s your opinion of the new play that comes out tonight?

Mrs. W.: “The Pocket Venus?” Why, they say young Mr. Garrick has a fine part; but he will never do anything as an actor.

Frizz: Miss Woffington says he will. He plays Jupiter tonight to her Venus; and if ever Venus had such a wig as that, may the scarcity of lard raise the price of bear’s-grease ’.

Mrs. W.: Do you know the Royal Family are coming tonight?

Frizz: Oh, yes; and the Ministers will all be here.

Mrs. W.: But I hope not the Opposition.

Frizz: In fact, the whole of London.

Enter STULPH, c. D.

Stulph: And I-------

Both: You ’

Stulph: Baron Von Stulph, Plenipotentiary Extraordinary to the most Puissant the Stadtholder of Holland.

Mrs. W.: (To Frizz.) Ask him what’s his business here.

Frizz: I will. (To Stulph.) Who do you want?

Stulph: Nobody. You perceive I sit down.

Frizz: Yes; I see that.

Stulph: If you stop you will observe that I will wait.

Mrs. W.: Are you aware that this is Miss Woffington’s dressing-room?

Stulph: I shouldn’t wonder;

Frizz: She will be here to undress directly.

Stulph: I shall be proud to see her.

Frizz: Do you mean, sir-------

Stulph: I do.

Frizz: But I say, sir-----

Stulph: I say so, too!

Frizz: Will you go?

Stulph: Ahem! I’m getting into a passion! I am terrifically excited. I shall cut your ears off with your own razors—I feel I shall!

Enter MERESTICK, L. H. 2 e.

Mere: (At door.) May I come in? Don’t be frightened. I won’t look. (Turns his head away.) Where—where is she, my angel? Venus, arise! (Turning to Stulph.) What a porpoise!

Mrs. W.: Oh, here’s one of the performers!

Mere: Not come yet! Why, the overture is on!

Mrs. W.: You know, whenever Miss Woffington plays a new part, she always dresses at home.

Mere: Who is that heavy tragedy figure? He looks like Quin in a quinsy.

Frizz: A fellow who has forced himself into the room and won’t quit.

Mere: Oh, forced himself in, has he!

Frizz: (Aside.) Now we’ll see.

Mere: (Advancing to Stulph.) Ahem!

Mere: I'll resent that. Who the devil are you—a billsticker, or a boxkeeper, or a bailiff? Shall I order a scene-shifter to come here and remove one-half a flat? Damme, sir, I'm up!
Stulph: (Rising slowly.) Now, observe what you have done. You see the Vesuvius of my rage. (Draws his sword slowly.) I am volcanically excited.
Mere: He's drawing his sword!
Frizz: (Running behind the cheval glass.) He's a lunatic! (Mrs. Willet screams. Merestick is chased by Stulph behind the sofa.)
Stulph: My passions are very ungovernable—(thrusts at him)—quite irrepressible—(thrusts)—in fact, I'm a maniac under their influence! (Thrusts.) Isn't it appalling?
(Merespick defends him with a cushion.)
MISS WOFFINGTON enters, c., quickly and in great agitation, dressed as Venus, but enveloped in a cloak. She closes the door.
Miss W.: I have escaped him! Ha, ha! Nearly caught me though! What a devil he is. If he pursues me thus, I shall inevitably fall in love with him at last.
Mere: She's here! I'm saved!
Stulph: The Woffington!
Mere: My guardian angel!
Miss W.: Ah! my ambassador.
Frizz: An ambassador! We shall all be hanged!
Mere: Pooh! I'm a favourite. I'll play Brutus to her Marc Antony any night, and see who the British public will applaud. (Bows to Stulph, and places a chair for him.)
Miss W.: Excuse me. I'm late. I must conclude my dressing. Don't stir.
Stulph: My loveliest of the lovely nation, you add graces to Venus tonight.
Miss W.: Frizz, the rouge! Go on, Baron.
Stulph: You are lovelier than yourself.
Miss W.: Oh, Stulph!
Stulph: But who is that shadow of yours, that young fellow who-----
Miss W.: Oh! young George Tarleton, hang the fellow—Willet, the powder!—a banker's heir, who ran through his fortune in a year.
Mere: He pesters Miss Woffington with love-letters.
Miss W.: Hold your tongue, Jerry! Yes, Baron; if he would content himself with breaking my doors in, knocking down my foot-
Frizz and Mrs. W.: Bravo! (Stulph turns upon him. Merestick walks away.)
Mere: (Aside to Frizz.) Shall I knock him down?
Mrs. W.: Yes, do.
Mere: I can't; he is down. Never hit a man when he's down. Besides, he's bigger than I am; generosity is therefore my cue. No; I'll be keen in speech—I'll shrivel him up with my severity! (To Stulph.) Sir, who—who are you? (Aside to Mrs. Willet and Frizz.) That's sarcastic, I think.
Stulph: Before I answer, whom do I address?
Mere: Fairly retorted. (Aloud.) Sir, I am Merestick, T.R.D.L.
Stulph: Ah! Vat's dat?
Mere: Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.
Stulph: Booh! Booh!
Mere: First dancer, and a considerable favourite.
Stulph: (Turning lazily.) I am satisfied.
Mere: He says he's satisfied—I can't do more than give him satisfaction.
Frizz: But you?
Mere: You—ah! But I am not. By what right are you here?
MRS. W. and FRIZZ: Bravo, bravo!

STULPH: Are you her husband?

MERE: No, but I shall be. Listen, sir. Five years ago, a poor, ragged little girl offered herself to this theatre to do everything for fifteen shillings a week. Her misery won my good nature, and I got her an engagement. That little girl, as the celebrated Miss Woffington, now gets fifty pounds a week! When she first came here, I was only a back figurant at eighteen shillings a week, and found my own pumps, calves, and tights. However, as she went up she pulled me along with her, and I now get a solo every night, and regularly hissed as sure as I do it. But I don’t care; I know who’ll be tired first. I am not obliged to do the degrading things I did formerly—sometimes I was the forelegs of an elephant; sometimes, like Jonas, put inside a fish to wag his tail; sometimes a wind--,

STULPH: I should think so!

MERE: I nearly blew my inside out. Never mind, the wind opened the door to Peg, and out of gratitude she means to marry me.

STULPH: Pooh!

MERE: Why not?

STULPH: Because you are, without hesitation, the ugliest beast I ever looked twice at.

FRIZZ: There, sir; now astonish him.

MERE: Give him time to retract. (Aloud.) You remarked------

STULPH: That you were damn’d ugly.

[Page header and footer removed]

MISS W.: My prudence and my virtue! Yes, but I am an actress—the fickle world’s fondling of the hour; but some day, when I have worn out its liking—when some vaunting fashionable meets his empty-pated fellow in Pall Mall, “Ah!” cries Dawdle, “I saw you yesterday in the Park!” “And I you,” replies Lord Dust-train, “how close you kept to little Woffington—eh? Ah, something--“Naw, naw—positively—don’t--“You are the favoured!” “Fine creature, by Jove; but don’t tell it—no, I didn’t think it was visible. Bye, bye,” and so before supper all the town cast up their eyes and cry, “Ah, well, what was she but an actress?” Thus will I lose in a day the prudence of a life. And if so, my indignation shall scarce cost me a staylace! Frizz, the pomatum!

STULPH: What a blessing it is that we men are born without reputations.

MERE: And sometimes without brains. (A noise without. Looking out, c. D.) Someone is coming up.

MISS W.: My dear Baron, you must go. No, not that way! Here, this passage leads into the front of the theatre.

STULPH: I go. I must pay my respects in the Queen’s box. I am wild with love. What apology can I offer for appearing before Her Majesty in this excited state.
Miss W.: Say I sent you.

Stulph: Adieu, Divinity!
[Exit, L.]

Miss W.: Farewell, Stolidity. [Closes the door.]
So there goes enough of the gross masculine earth to destroy the reputation of Penelope.
Now, Jerry, if you do not get dressed you’ll be too late to be my Triton when I rise from the sea.

Mere: [Still looking out.] Oh, ye gods! and to think I shall have a pas before such a Venus.
I shall pirouette round her till I grow giddy with delight. [Going.]
Hollo! somebody has put the light out in the passage. Somebody’s there.
Hollo, none of your nonsense or I’ll tell the manager! Who are you?
(He is grasped behind, turned round, flung out by George Tarleton, and heard to fall down-stairs, crying “Murder!”
George stands in his place. Miss Woffington having gone up to see the cause of the noise, starts back, having shut the door.)

Miss W.: Ah—’tis he!

Tarleton: Herself, by Heaven. [After a pause of embarrassment.] Will you forgive this insolence? Such I confess it is, yet how shall I excuse it? By admitting, perhaps, a deeper insult. My name is----

Miss W.: Is George Tarleton.

Tarleton: To hear it from your lips, dearest! [Advancing.]

Miss W.: Sir, this intrusion is unmanly! Leave me!

Tarleton: Oh, madam 1 if you only knew the hours I have spent opposite that window! Every stone in the street, from here to your home, is worn by the traffic of my love! There isn’t a brick in your house that I’m not acquainted with! I’ve had for years but one employment—to follow you! To-night jealousy first seized me. I saw--

Miss W.: What?

Tarleton: A man’s shadow on the blind, there—a fat man!

Miss W.: [Aside.] Aha—Stulph!

Tarleton: So I forced the stage door, flew up the stairs, and stood before you—in a thought----

Miss W.: Well, sir, and what is your wish?

Tarleton: Let me tell you that an hour hence----

Miss W.: You are not in earnest, sir.

Tarleton: I only know I am in love.

Miss W.: You jest.

Tarleton: I have ruined myself for your sake.

Miss W.: The old story, They all say that.

Tarleton: A private box every night—bouquets in diamond rings to throw to you—the jewels you have always refused to accept, which, in my rage, I gave to others.

Miss W.: And your prospects?

Tarleton: Destroyed, by that fair face. My uncle the Marquis had made me attache to the Parisian Embassy; my prospects were most brilliant. I was sent with despatches for the ambassador; I saw you in London. Enough. The despatches went by post.

Miss W.: Ha! ha! That’s delicious! Well?

Tarleton: They fell into the wrong hands. A mighty intrigue spoiled. Ministry kicked out. So was I.

Miss W.: But when I left London------

Tarleton: I followed you; or, rather, preceded you.

Miss W.: Ah! perhaps, then, you can explain why all the hotels flew open to my carriage. Landlords refused their bills, packets the fare. I travelled free.

Tarleton: Because you trod upon the gold which I had scattered on your path.

Miss W.: Extravagant wretch! Suppose, now, I should love another?

Tarleton: Very well—I’ll blow his brains.
I Tarleton; (Aside.) Send him up—aha! I'll strangle him in the hall.

[Steals out, E. H.

Miss W. And tell him—I watches Tarleton till she sees him. out, then shuts the door upon him.) So, now show up the lady.

Mere. She is here. En avant seul. (Aside.) I do believe she has injured my elevation..

Enter LADY ANNE SCHEMER, c., deeply veiled.

Miss W. Go!

Mere. Oh, when I'm married I won't be turned out unless professionally.. Now for my other calf. [Exit, c. Lady Schemer unveils.

Miss W. Lady Anne Schemer!

Lady A. Hush—I would not be known here.

Miss W. No; a Premier's wife in an actress's dressing-room is too deep a condescension.

Lady A. Don't be proud. I merely meant that the business upon which I came demanded secrecy.

Miss W. Law! what is it?

Lady A. We are alone?

Miss W. Quite.

Lady A. Hush!

(Tarleton shakes the door, R. H.)

Tarleton. (Without.) Ho! ho!

Lady A. What's that?

Miss W. It is only my puppy. (Aside.) What fun if the Baron should return by that door! (Aloud.) Don't be alarmed. I lock him up because I think he's inclined to go mad now and then.

Lady A. I wonder you keep the animal.

Miss W. I don't; he follows me about, and won't be frightened off.

Lady A. Well, this secret is—a State

Miss W. What! and I? Oh! this is delightful. Well, come; what am I to do?

Lady A. This volatility will spoil all.

Miss W. Not a bit of it. Good-humour never spoiled anything yet.

Lady A. Well, you must------------ (Stulph shakes door, L. H.) What's that?

Miss W. (Aside.) Aha, hurrah! The Baron, by all that's fat! What fun!

Stulph. (Without.) Woffy! Woffy, my angel!

Lady A. Is that another puppy?

Miss W. Ha! ha! ha! that's my cockatoo—ha, ha, ha! (Aside.) That Stulph will be the death of me—'pon my life he will!

Lady A. To business! When the Marquis de Mousseux was ambassador here from the out!

Miss W. You inhuman monster!

Tarleton. All my humanity is centered in yourself.

MERESTICK peeps in, C.

Mere. My angel!

Miss W. I'm lost—oh, my reputation! (Snatching up her cloak and concealing herself, and at the same time hides Tarleton.) How dare you come in, you little wretch, when I am dressing! Get out!

(He enters, half-dressed as a Triton, without his wig, with stuffings on one leg, but not on the other.)

Mere. My dearest life! I suddenly, while dressing, recollected that in our embracing scene---

(She looks over the cloak and sees his legs.)

Miss W. Alia! ha! ha!

Mere. What? Eh, oh, my legs! Yes. I see you imagine there is a little difference in size between them. Ha! ha! Very good. An ocular delusion. My legs are subject to a—a (Aside.) Damme, I forgot my other stuffing.

Miss W. Ha! ha!
HA!

(Drops into the arm-chair convulsed, allowing Tarleton to see the legs.)

Tarleton: Aha! ha! <

Mere: Another stranger here! Aha! Was it you that threw me over the banisters just now? How dare you enter, sir? I am Merestick, this lady’s intended.

Tarletqn: I know it, and I am George Tarleton.

Mere: Ah! (Starts back, Tarleton follows.)

Tableton: The man that hissed you for two years, and who is ready to begin again in half an hour, if you dare aspire to her whom I adore!

Mere: Well, this is cool.

Miss W.: Come, Jerry, what do you want?

Mere: I was coming to rehearse our embracing before my fins are on, but a person in the passage gave me this letter for you.

Tarleton: Ha! a lover. So, he dies!

Miss W.: (Reads.) How’s this? Ha! (Aside.) How to get rid of my hot friend here. Ha!

Mere: It’s a la------

Miss.W.: Hold your tongue. (Treading on his toes.)

Mere: Oh! You’ve destroyed the Paw de Triton or the Dance of Marine Stores.

Miss W.: Very well—send him up by these stairs. [Exit Miss W.]

French Court, I think he paid you some attention?

Miss W.: Yes; he called upon me one evening, and paid me two thousand pounds. I took the notes, put them in the candle, and lighted his lordship out with them. Ha! ha!

Lady A.: What did he say?

Miss W.: That it was civil, but rather expensive, and not at all the flame he expected to illumine.

Lady A.: But he persevered?

Miss W.: Like a circum—navigator.

Lady A.: And obtained—?

MISS W.: Nothing.

Lady A.: Honour—?

Miss W.: Bright!

Lady A.: Hum—and this ambassador?

Miss W.: Oh—my lump of Dutch cheese! Yes; he amuses me—ha! ha!—and interests me.—I am nervous at seeing him stand quiet for long—for fear he should congeal—a volcano in an iceberg—a natural phenomenon I have no desire to fathom.

Lady A.: And he has obtained—?

Miss W.: As much as the Marquis.

Lady A.: Suppose, now, my husband were willing to send you to Paris?

Miss W.: I would go to the world’s end to serve him.

Lady A.: Indeed?

Miss W.: (With deep emotion.) For he is good as he is great. On a bleak winter’s day, some nine years since, a poor girl without a home or a hearth to shelter her, fatherless and motherless, crying for very want of food—her heart too proud to beg—was observed by your husband, lady. “This is real want,” said he, and, giving me a purse, bade me be of better cheer and use it honestly. The child could not speak, but falling on her knees held up her little hands to Heaven and offered up a grateful prayer for her benefactor’s weal. That timely aid saved her from endless misery.

Lady A.: Poor child! But how came you so well acquainted with her story?

Miss W.: It was myself!

Lidy A.: Indeed! Then my mission is certain of being accomplished.
MISS W.: But what am I to do in Paris?

LADY A.: Hush! It's a State secret, I tell you. Would you consent to serve your country?

MISS W.: You mean by supporting the Ministry? With what am I to be entrusted?

LADY A.: With--

[Enter TABLETON, c.]

TARLETON: So, where is this paramour?

LADY A.: George Tarleton!

TARLETON: Draw, villain, whoever you are!

MISS W.: Who? Lady?--(laughing.)

TARLETON: A woman! (Confused.)

LADY A.: (To Miss W.) Hush, not a word! Do you know the fellow?

MISS W.: To my plague; I do.

LADY A.: The greatest fool------- 

TARLETON: (Aside.) Lady Anne Schemer.

LADY A.: Ruined himself; flung away the brightest fortune for some little minx he fell in love with, who, ten to one, laughs at him in return.

MISS W.: (Aside.) It was true. He does love me. Poor devil.

TARLETON: (Aside.) They are laughing at me.

LADY A.: I must leave you for the present. May I say that you consent?

MISS W.: To take office--yes. (To Tarlton.) Come, George--I mean Mr. Tarleton--your arm to this lady. Conduct her to her lord's box.

TABLETON: (Aside.) So she wants to get rid of me! (Objecting.) Madam, I must beg--

LADY A.: Me to accept your arm--certainly.

MISS W.: Mr. Tarleton is too delighted, I'm sure. (Laughing at him.)

TARLETON: Oh, yes--yes. (Aside.) I shall return before you expect it.

[Exeunt Tarleton and Lady Schemer, c.]

MISS W.: (Sighing.) And he has sacrificed his fortune, prospects, hopes--all--all for me, and I can restore him nothing. For me, I never felt I was loved before. Loved! I wonder what loving is like. Is it what I begin to feel here--(touches her heart)--tax him? Stay! Yes, I see how I can restore to him his forfeited position. I can make him the State creditor--

[STULPH enters and comes down.]

MISS W.: --then, when fortune once more smiles on him, if he but smile on me, I'll--

STULPH: He does smile on you. Look! - (Smiles frigidly.)

MISS W.: Ugh! (Shivers.) The Aurora Borealis.

STULPH: Don't turn away, or I shall go mad, despairing. I am furious already. I am groaning under misfortune.

MISS W.: How?

STULPH: I quit London tonight.

MISS W.: Quit London?

STULPH: Hush. A secret.

MISS W.: Another secret?

STULPH: An order just arrived from the Stadtholder. I must be gone at once and in secret.

MISS W.: To Holland?

STULPH: No, to Paris.

MISS W.: To Paris? You're joking. (Aside.) Now what the deuce are we all going to do in Paris?

STULPH: It is a State secret.

MISS W.: (Aside.) So is mine. No time must be lost.
MISS W: You set out at once?
STULPH: To-night. Therefore, I must entreat you to get ready.
MISS W: What for?
STULPH: What enrapturing innocence, adored Margaret.
MISS W: Stulph!
STULPH: No, Heinrich! I call you Margaret, you reply Heinrich. I like it best so. Listen; in half an hour my carriage will be at the private door at the foot of that staircase.
MISS W: Well, what for?
STULPH: Enchanting Margaret!
MISS W: Incomprehensible Stulph!
STULPH: No, Heinrick; I prefer it. Promise me to await me at the place and time I have mentioned.
MISS W: But my other lovers?
STULPH: Ten thousand million furies. The words blaze me! I am scorched! I die with pent up rage! Was ever man so fearfully the victim of such passion? Is this blood that rushes through my veins?
MISS W (Aside): No, I should say it was beer. (Noise without) You must go—indeed, you must.
STULPH: Divine Margaret—see! I have provided passports—your name inserted. All is prepared.
MISS W: Leave it then, and perhaps I may—
CALL BOY (Putting his head in): Please, Miss Woffington, you are called.
STULPH: I fly—on the wings of hope and love.
MERESTICK and TARLETON enter.
MERE: The Queen has arrived. Come, the curtain is up.
TARLETON: I saw someone escape by that door.
MERE (To Tarleton): I'm sure of it.
MISS W: You remember our first scene?
MERE: Let's see, you rise from the sea during the chorus, then you step on shore, I kneel so. (Aside to Tarleton) It was that fat ambassador.
TARLETON: Then Lady Anne has told me truth!
MISS W: Now, Jerry, you rise. George Tarleton—“My guide and beauteous storekeeper of the deep,” what did she say?
TARLETON: She told me that you received lovers—
MISS W: “For the home I found within thy pearly dwelling-thanks!” (Merestick dances, expressing love.)
TARLETON: You receive lovers here in secret.
MERESTICK: Disgusting! (Stamping.)
MISS W: Take care, Jerry, if you treat your poor dear little soft legs so—
MERE: Soft! Look here, there's muscle! Perfidious woman, look at that.
TARLETON: That you loved a wretch, a fool!
MISS W: And why not?
TARLETON: Who is he?
MISS W: “Sweet Triton, what new thoughts are born within me—tell me, my heart, what wouldst thou have me do—Explain!” (Merestick pirouettes and kicks Tarleton.) There, you will interfere.
MERE: And spoilt my rond de jambe—
TARLETON: I'll break that dancing dog's head. Ah, dearest, would you drive me to despair? Don't, for I am destructive!
MISS W: How?
TARLETON: I'll murder all you love!
MERE: Then I'm a dead man!
MISS W: Kill him I love? Commit suicide first.
CALL BOY opens door.
CALL BOY: Miss Woffington, the stage waits.
MISS W: I go. (Going.)
MERE: Where glory waits thee.
TARLETON: Explain that word "suicide." You love me?
MISS W: Come, Jerry! [Exit, C. D.
MERE: Oh, the coming embrace! [Exit, C. D.
TARLETON: What did she say?
AXIL: A glimmer of hope? When I said I would murder all she loved, she answered, "'Twould be suicide." Then she loves me. (Sees passport.) What's this--a passport to Paris? For whom? Herself and the fat ambassador. What can this mean? I'll make him eat it, seal and all!

Enter LADY ANNE.

LADY ANNE: On the stage. How provoking!

TARLETON: Lady Anne again! Your ladyship need not start. I know all!

LADY ANNE: All! (Aside.) We're lost.

TARLETON: It is the Dutch Ambassador she loves.

LADY ANNE: Oh! that is all.

TARLETON: She mocks me. I despise, loathe, hate, detest her!

LADY ANNE: You are right.

TARLETON: But I'll have satisfaction from this Dutchman.

LADY ANNE: Do. (Applause heard.) You hear--that is her reception.

TARLETON: Let's go and see her.

LADY ANNE: No, you go. I'll stop and tell her how you loathe and despise her.

TARLETON: What fun! Loathe, despise--who ever heard such words applied to such a creature?

LADY ANNE: Well, then, I'll say you love her--that you are dying by inches.

TARLETON: Feet--feet! Yards!

LADY ANNE: I'll settle it.

TARLETON: My gratitude.

LADY ANNE: She comes!

Enter MISS WOFFINGTON and MERESTICK.

TARLETON: (Aside.) Now to discover if this Dutch animal escaped by this door.

[Exit, unseen by them, L. H.

MISS WOFFINGTON: How, your ladyship again?

LADY ANNE: I heard the applause.

MISS WOFFINGTON: That scene went very well.

MERESTICK: Well? It was a blaze! My pirouette was immense. I spun till I positively hummed.

MISS WOFFINGTON: Ay! I thought I only wanted a whip to keep you spinning for ever. Go, prepare for your next hum.

MERESTICK: I fly! Hollo! My calf has turned round to my shin. Ah! That was why I did not feel my entrechat. I was wondering what the audience were laughing at. I'll go and lack the dresser, and then kick the manager for a new pair. The manager must be done, my dear--that's one of the first principles of dancing--ha! ha! ha! ha!

[Exit, c., dancing off.

MISS WOFFINGTON: Now, then.

LADY ANNE: Lord Schemer is delighted with you and confides implicitly. You must set out at once.

MISS WOFFINGTON: I have had an offer of a seat in a carriage already, and half a passport to Paris.

LADY ANNE: From whom?

MISS WOFFINGTON: Baron Von Stulph.

LADY ANNE: Ha! I see it. Holland is trying to outwit us. You must see the Marquis De Mousseux before the Dutch Ambassador.

MISS WOFFINGTON: I'm off. But what shall I say when I do see him?

LADY ANNE: You will learn that in Paris. A despatch will be left at the Hotel des Princes. Be prudent, and you have the best thanks of His Majesty.

MISS WOFFINGTON: How? Is the King in it?

LADY ANNE: Deep! Your departure must-- 

MISS WOFFINGTON: Be secret, of course?

LADY ANNE: Not at all; that would excite suspicion.
It must be done openly, to blind the more.
 
Miss W: But the manager ?
 
Lady A: We’ll settle that. Let’s see. Could you not manage an enlovement?
 
Miss W: Why do you give crimes French names? Does it sanctify them?
 
Lady A: Nonsense, dear! This is a State affair. Could you not get up an abduction—carried off, eh?
 
Miss W: But my character?
 
Lady A: Talking of that, you will receive one thousand pounds for the travelling expenses and one hundred pounds a day during your residence abroad.
 
Miss W: One hundred pounds a day. I’ll prolong the negotiation indefinitely. I’ll send His Majesty a note of thanks.
 
Lady A: Well thought of. When you write home of this affair you must not designate parties.
 
Miss W: Call people names—I never do.
 
Lady A: In this diplomatic correspondence you will use figures, thus:—The King, 1; Lord Schemer, 2.
 
Miss W: The Marquis?
 
Lady A: Nine. And the Dutchman?
 
Miss W: Nought.
 
Lady A: Exactly. As for the abduction you must—
 
Enter TARLETON, L. H., unperceived.
 
—pick out some lover who is always following you.
 
Miss W: There is only that poor devil, Tarleton.
 
Tarleton. (Aside.) So, so! (Conceals himself behind the hoop.)
 
Lady A: No, he won’t do; he’s a fool, and would spoil all.
 
Tarleton. (Aside.) That listeners hear no good of themselves seems true.
 
Lady A: Stay, I have it. Excellent!
 
Miss W: Who?
 
Lady A: The ambassador himself.
 
Miss W: Ha! ha! ha!
 
Tarleton. Indeed.
 
Miss W: (Hearing a noise.) Hey?
 
Lady A: What?
 
(They look round the room. Tarleton conceals himself by getting inside the hoop, through the top opening of which he occasionally puts his head to listen.)
 
Lady A: No one. He will fly in a moment—at a word—to-night, even! What are you laughing at?
 
Miss W: Why, only—ha! ha. His carriage is now waiting for the very purpose at the private door there. (Points, L. H.)
 
Lady A: Fate aids me! I must leave you, then.
 
Miss W: My reputation?
 
Lady A: Escape, and we’ll raise a statue to it!
 
[Exit, laughing, c. d.]
 
Miss W: Stay; tell me. She is gone. What shall I do? (As she goes to the door, c., Tarleton, in the hoop, intercepts her.)
 
Tarleton. (Starting out.) Fly with me.
 
Miss W: (Screams.) Hush! (Throws off hoop.) What do you want?
 
Tarleton: To carry you off.
 
Miss W: I daresay. (Noise.) Someone comes.
 
Tarleton: Let ’em. (Locks the door.) And let us begone.
 
Miss W: Where, maniac?
 
Tarleton: China! New York! Heaven! Paris! anywhere!
 
Miss W: Never! Besides, my embracing scene is next.
 
Tarleton: We’ll play it here. (Noise without and knocking at door. He passes his arm round her waist.)
 
Miss W: Fool! Ha! ha! Would you carry me all the way? I can’t help laughing! You have no conveyance?
 
Tarleton: I’ll borrow the Baron’s.
 
Miss W: Ha! ha. And the passport?
 
Tarleton: Is here.
[Outside.] The stage waits! Quick!
Miss W.: You hear, the stage waits!
Tarleton: He means the stage coach. Come!
Miss W.: Never! Not a foot! Ha! Ha!
Tarleton: No time must be lost.
Miss W.: I’d give the world to be severe, but I can’t. Begone, sir, I won’t stir a step.
Tarleton: Then you must be carried.
Miss W.: Help! Ha! Ha! Fire! Ha! Ha! You wretch! I’ll — oh, my reputation!
[He carries her out, L. H. The centre door is burst open.]
Enter MERESTICK, MRS. WILLET, FRIZZ, CALL BOY.
Mere: Really, this is disgusting! Holloa! Where is she?
Enter STULPH.
Stulph: Gone — carried off!
Mere: Carried off? Carry me out, and bury me decently!
Stulph: Carried off by a wretch. I arrived just in time to be knocked down by my own carriage. She was inside. I heard her laugh. The villain, in my postillion’s saddle, spurred the horses into a gallop, and gave me a cut as I rolled in the kennel.
[All laugh. Rubs himself behind.]
Mere: Ah, laugh, unfeeling wretches. What’s to become of my Pas de Marine Stores? Give me a cloak. Here is one. [Takes up cloak.] Not a moment shall be lost. I will pursue them.
Stulph: Catch her, and I will give you a thousand pounds!
Call Boy: Miss Woffington, you’re called, please.
Stulph: Announce to the public that the evening’s entertainment must conclude with the abduction of Miss Woffington.
Mere: Or Merestick’s revenge. [As he rushes out, the act-drop descends. Several actors and actresses dressed for the ballet appear at the back, Frizz, and Mrs. Willet.]
End of Act I.

ACT II.

SCENE — An Elegant Apartment in the Hotel des Princes. Doors R. L. and c. of flat. A table covered with writing material; a closet, R. H.
Enter the MARQUIS DE MOUSSEUX and a WAITER, C.
Waiter: Yes, my lord; Miss Woffington arrived here yesterday.
Marquis: To whom did she send?
Waiter: To the opera to secure a box.
Marquis: Is she within?
Waiter: No, my lord.
Marquis: Not within, at this hour! [Sits at table.]
Enter TARLETON, c.
Waiter: Who did you want, my lord?
Tarleton: Go to the devil! I’m not a lord — I’m an Englishman arrived yesterday with Miss Woffington.
Marquis: What’s this?
Waiter: Beg pardon, sir, she is out.
Tarleton: Out!
Waiter: Yes, my lord.
Tarleton: I’ll tell you what, if you “my lord” me, I’ll throw you out of the window. [Exit Waiter, c.] Out, out, out! [Sits at table.]
Marquis: You are troubled about it, sir? (Without rising.)
Tarleton: A stranger! Sir, you await Miss Woffington’s return?
Marquis: No — that is, yes — about an affair of importance.
Tarleton: Oh! You are the manager of a theatre, perhaps?
Marquis: Yes; rather a large one, and a very expensive company.
Tarleton: (Aside.) There is something about this fellow I don’t like. (Rising. Aloud.) Sir, I beg to inform you that, unless your intentions are purely of a business-like character, your presence here is an insult.

Marquis: What does the fellow mean?

Tarleton: In spite of this abduction. (Crosses to r. h.)

Marquis: How? Was she carried off from London? (Rising.)

Tarleton: You did not hear of that? Yes— I—that is, one of my friends did it. (Aside.) The devil! I mustn’t hoast yet.

Marquis: I congratulate your friend on his spirit.

Tarleton: Yes; he was madly in love with lier, and having no means of introduction--

Marquis: He carried her off.

Tarleton: Exactly; but is just now as far from his intention as before he knew her.

Marquis: Oh, come, sir, you jest!

Tarleton: ’Pon my life, no. On placing her in the carnage he discovered, to his agony, that there was no post-boy, and so he was obliged to mount and ride eighty miles on the damnedest saddle!

Marquis: Ha! Ha!

Tarleton: I assure you ’twar no joke. I dare not sit down since.

Marquis: (Aside.) Exactly. He is his friend. (Aloud.) But on her arrival in Paris----

Tarleton: She shut herself up, denied herself to everyone, surrounded with mystery. My friend is in a desperate passion.

Marquis: Well, tell your friend I laud his spirit, but—ha! Ha!—the saddle—all night—no doubt!

Tarleton: And such a night—torrents!

Marquis: It is a capital story. Ha! Ha! Ha! Poor devil! Ha! Ha! Ha! Poor devil! Ha! Ha! Ha!

[Exit, c.]

Tarleton: What can this mean? Why do I submit to it? When we arrived at Calais, won by her entreaties, prayers, and her praises of my horsemanship, did I not, martyred as I was, mount again into that devil of a saddle and spur two unholy quadrupeds two hundred miles? Did I not hear her laugh behind me? Yet I have loved her, and--- Hollo, what is here? (Reads a paper on table, L. H.)

Enter MISS WOFFINGTON and WAITER, c.

Miss W.: I tell you on no account admit anyone.

Waiter: But, madame---------

Miss W.: Not even the English gentleman who arrived with me.

Tarleton: What’s that?

Miss W.: Tarleton.

Waiter: There, I told you so, my lord.

Tarleton: My lord again! You see the window?

[Exit Waiter, hastily, c.]

Miss W.: Ha! Ha! You wretch! Always the same mad-brained devil, London or Paris.

Tarleton: Because you are at both.

Miss W.: Has not the journey cured you? Shower baths and exercise are fine remedies for madness.

Tarleton: Well, now we are in Paris, I am to play the part of-

Miss W.: A restful adorer.

Tarleton: Is that all I’m to get for running off with you?

Miss W.: Patience.

Tarleton: There is some mystery in this.

Miss W.: It’s possible.

Tarleton: I will find it out.

Miss W.: Try.

Tarleton: Last night, though I took a box at your desire at the Opera, you went to the Academic.

Miss W.: Oh, you have discovered that. Well?

Tarleton: Perhaps you went to—(looks at the paper aside)—to see Number Seven.

Miss W.: (Alarmed.) Eh! How!
Tarleton: At least, an assignation with Nought.

Miss W.: (Aside.) I'm lost. (Aloud.) I can't imagine what you mean.

Tarleton: Mean. 'Perfidious woman, is that your writing?

Miss W.: My letter!

Tarleton: (Reads.) "My dear Number Five, on my arrival in Paris I wrote to Number Eight and called on Number Four, and I have hopes of seeing Number Eleven before Nought arrives." Now, who the devil are Four, Five, Eight, Eleven, and Nought?

Miss W.: I leave you to find out.

Tarleton: Do not trifle with my love, do explain this mystery.

Miss W.: George, suppose that on this mystery depends your fortune. I ask you to trust me.

Tarleton: You look serious.

Stulph: To arrest the rascal who stole away my treasure.

Miss W.: (Aside.) Oh, my poor, mad-headed George! What shall I do or say?

Stulph: Where is he?

Miss W.: Hush!

Stulph: What?

Miss W.: Listen! (Aside. I must tell a lie here. Aloud.) Hush! he sleeps.

Stulph: The villain!

Miss W.: Silence! He is my husband.

Stulph: Married?

Miss W.: Ah.

Stulph: But how is this?

Miss W.: How is it?

Stulph: Just so.

Miss W.: I'll tell you; but it's a long story.

Stulph: I'm patient.

Miss W.: Hah! (Aside.) Heaven send me through it! (Aloud.) I was young-very young. A young Frenchman-a man of fortune-made love to me here, in Paris, then we-ahem! You understand?

Stulph: Perfectly. I see the end of it.

Miss W.: (Aside.) I wish I did. (Aloud.) He was a splendid man-I had always a fancy for fine-looking men, Heinrich.

Stulph: Ah! flatterer!

Miss W.: We were married secretly-a-that is, in private; but my father-a-a-I had a father once-he discovered it-violent passion-separated us-never seen each other since till now. You understand.

Stulph: Perfectly. (Aside.) But I don't believe.

Miss W.: (Aside.) He doubts it; who cares.

Stulph: This husband of yours, is he strong?

Miss W.: I saw him kill both your carriage horses with blows of his fist because they kicked!

Stulph: He is asleep, you say?

Miss W.: Yes; and I was about to write to the Dutch Embassy here to appoint a rendezvous. But perhaps you are engaged.

Stulph: Not at all.

Miss W.: This State affair-

Stulph: 'Tis concluded.

Miss W.: (Aside.) Oh, mercy!

Stulph: I have read to him the treaty. He has consented to the terms.

Miss W.: And signed it?

Stulph: Not yet.

Miss W.: (Aside.) I breathe again!

Miss W.: I am so, for- (She whispers to him, he kisses her.)
Tarleton: No more. Bid me do what you will, go where you will, to Algiers, Lapland, Seringapatam, the devil, it’s all the same to me.

Miss W.: And to me, too.

Tarleton: Let’s be off. This morning I received a letter from Lafittes’ of unlimited credit.

Miss W.: (Aside.) Already, Lord Schemer, you are prompt indeed.

Tarleton: I’ll go, get a thousand pounds, and we’ll fly. (Exit Tarleton, c. d.)

Miss W.: I’ll take care to have a spare saddle for you though. Poor George, how he loves me. But I must not think of that yet—business first, pleasure afterwards. So, here I am, Peg Woffington, in Paris, Minister Extraordinary of His Brittanic Majesty, empowered to ratify a treaty of commerce between France and England. Let me but succeed, then, George, I am yours. Now for my instructions. (She reads.) ‘See le Marquis de Mousseux before the arrival of the Baron.’ I have—saw him last night at the Academie, he entered my box breathing protestations. ‘The treaty of commerce depends on the power of this young Minister.’ Conclude it done, my lord. ‘Only detain my ambassador four and twenty hours more in London.’ Ha! ha! I wonder where he is now; at Calais, perhaps, or at sea. Ha! ha! my poor Dutchman!

(Enter Waiter, c.)

Waiter: Baron Von Stulph!

(Exit Waiter. Enter Stulph, c.)

Stulph: Where’s my carriage?

Miss W.: Ha! ha! Have you pursued me? (Aside.) All’s lost! (Aloud.) How did you come!

Stulph: In a rascally post-chaise.

Miss W.: You arrived———

Stulph: Two hours ago.

Miss W.: You have seen the Marquis!

Stulph: This moment heard from him, After settling some State affairs, I learned your address; but there is that little animal running all over Paris, asking everyone he meets, “Where is Woffington—has she gone on?”

Miss W.: Who?

Stulph: Merestick. He preceded me on horseback. But don’t be alarmed, I have been to the Minister. The police will be here directly.

Miss W.: Good gracious! That’s just the very hour I have appointed; in fact, the only one I had to spare; but, of course, you could not disappoint—

Stulph: Nothing easier. I will write to him—

Miss W.: Will you? (Joyfully.)

Stulph: To name an earlier hour.

Miss W.: (Aside.) Lost again—a miracle can only save me!

Stulph: Farewell, then, till———

Miss W.: Stay a moment. See, write it here.

Stulph: Ah, you rogue, you would not part with me! (He sits and writes. She stands behind him, and drawing out tablets and pencil.)

Miss W.: What hour will you appoint for the Marquis de Mousseux?

Stulph: How! You know him?

Miss W.: Oh, yes; breakfasted with my husband this morning. They were laughing together about Holland and you.

Stulph: Indeed!

Miss W.: Yes—ha! ha! “They produce, nothing,” said my husband, “but coarse women and fat statesmen.”

Stulph: Ah! I’ll make your husband a present for that.
MISS W.: “No, fair play,” said the Marquis. “They do make very fair cheese.”
STULPH: The devil!
MISS W.: So—(aside)—there’s a war lighted.
STULPH: (Writes.) “My lord, I will see you at your house at eleven o’clock.”
MISS W.: (Writes, aside.) ‘‘My lord, I await you here at eleven o’clock.”
STULPH: *“Await me.”
MISS W.: “Come.”
STULPH: “I will grant------”
MISS W.: “I will grant-------”
STULPH: “All you can wish.”
MISS W.: (Aside). “Nothing at all.”
STULPH: So, I sign, and at twelve I am your slave.
MISS W.: (Aside.) Oh, my country, if you knew what I am sacrificing for you. (Aloud.) Here, you tumbler—(snatches the envelope and letter from him)—look here. So, there—(puts her own letter inside it)—direct it. So—(looks over his letter. Aside)—that was clever. He sends my assignation. (Aloud.) You want a light. (Lights his letter at the fire. He seals it.)
STULPH: I forgot the date.
MISS W.: No matter. (M er ings.) Enter WAITER. Dispatch that. [Exit Waiter with letter.]
STULPH: You are too good.
MISS W.: Don’t mention it. I must leave you.
STULPH: At twelve?
MISS W.: Dear Baron!
STULPH: Margaret!
MISS W.: Heinrich! (Aside.) Ha! ha! I’ve done it. [Exit.]
STULPH: The hour approaches, the realization of all my hopes. I am on fire! Donner and blitzen, how I flame! What a fearful thing it is to have a temperament like mine. I’m tinder, gunpowder, every known combustible! (Noise without.) What means that cry? Let me see! (Looks out of the window.) A man chased by the mob! He comes this way—to this very house! He enters the court! If I be discovered in an actress’s chamber, what will my Government say? I’ll retreat. [Exit, L.]
MERESTICK, still in costume, leaps in at the window, staggers down the stage, and falls in an arm-chair. Enter TARLETON with his sword drawn.
MERE: Where am I? (Seeing Tarleton.) Murder! Another frog-spitter.
TARLETON: No, no, you are safe. Fear nothing, the doors are closed.
MERE: Oh, my friend, if you had not slipped in and pinked some of those Frenchmen, I was a lost Triton. What would have become of the Patent Theatres?
TARLETON: But this dress. Why did you travel in such a mythological neglige? Ha! ha! ha!
MERE: Don’t laugh. It was all your fault.
TARLETON: Mine! Ha! ha! ha!
MERE: And you can laugh. Yes, after you carried off Woffington everyone called out for somebody else to pursue. They threw a cloak over me and threw me on horseback. And such a horse, with such a back. Oh!
TARLETON: I know, I know. I feel for you.
MERE: He tried every known means to throw me; but no, I knew a trick or two more than he, mane and tail. But, perfidious devil he left them both in my hands. How I arrived at Dover I don’t know, but I remember rushing to a pawnbroker’s and buying a plain suit, and then flying down the pier; the bell was ringing.
I got to the wharf, but the vessel was just off. I had a jump for it, landed on the very edge of the deck, but lost my suit in the scramble.

Tarleton: Bravo! Go on.

Mere: Off we went, and then, oh, lord! how ill I got.

Tarleton: Ha! ha! Good! A Triton sea-sick.

Mere: Got to Calais at night. Yes, such ups and downs. Well, in Paris—there began my misfortunes. One fellow pulled my fins, another chucked my tail. "It's a fish!series one." "A cod!" "A salmon!" "Pitch him back into the water!" and I'll be hanged if they wouldn't, too, if you had not slipped in and drove them off; But where have I got to here?

Tarleton: The apartments of Miss Woffington.

Mere: Ah! I have given her up; she has forfeited my esteem.

Tarleton: No, for I assure you she has treated me at Paris as she did you in London.

Mere: Law!

Tarleton: But I'm on the trail of an intrigue. She met the Marquis de Mousseux last night at the theatre.

Mere: She deceives us both; but I'll confront her. {Going.)

Tarleton: No, I've a better plan. Be quiet. I'll challenge my rival.

Mere: Do. That's capital. {Aside.) Oh, if they only would kill each other!

Tarleton: In the meantime, do you watch her narrowly from here. {Opening door, L.)

Mere: I will.

Tarleton: Within you will find clothes.

Mere: But I should like-----

Tarleton: There, go along! {Pushes him in, L. H.)

Enter MISS WOFFINGTON, with paper, c.

Miss W.: Ah! have you not found the bank?

Tarleton: Yes, and more. I found out your intrigue with the Marquis. I have been to his house, insulted him, and left my card.

Miss W.: How?

Tarleton: And I tell you what. Whoever you meet here—French, Dutch, Chinese, or negro, by Jove! if I find him out, mark, he dies! Farewell.

[Exit, c.

Miss W.: {Imitating him.) If I find him out, he dies! Ha! ha! ha! he's a dear fellow! So I have just received the blank letters empowering the creation of an ostensible Charge d Affaires here. It recommends half a dozen; but I have one in my eye—my poor George. I'll make him ambassador. He's a fool, I know; but he's very handsome, and would kill all the world for my sake.

Enter the MARQUIS, C.

Marquis: Eleven o'clock to a second.

Miss W.: Punctuality itself.

Marquis: When bliss awaits me. {Offering to take her round the waist.)

Miss W.: Excuse me. {Shrinks from him.)

Marquis: How? Have I mistaken your letter?

Miss W.: No; but—{aside)—I'm in another scrape.

Marquis: Are you aware that for your sake a whole kingdom is left waiting?

Miss W.: You are too good.

Marquis: How came the Baron's seal on your letter to me?

Miss W.: You noticed it? Aha! why he was here, boring me horribly.

Marquis: Indeed! Are you sure?

Miss W.: Quite.
Marquis: And the proof?

Miss W.: Is contained in my letter to you.

Marquis: Charming!

Miss W.: Indeed, he called to see an English gentleman, who resides in this hotel. His name is Tarleton, I think. I was remarking to them that you were the greatest Minister France ever produced.

Marquis: Oh, now you flatter me.

Miss W.: And the handsomest man!

Marquis: Oh, you rogue! I don't believe it.

Miss W.: [Aside.] He does, every word [Aloud.] Stulph spoke slightingly I thought, but young Tarleton praised you to the skies.

Marquis: Stulph!

Miss W.: He remarked that you were easily duped, that you served his purpose.

Marquis: [Aside.] Aha! the devil! [Aloud.] Go on.

Miss W.: How, Marquis? You surely are not here to talk politics?

Marquis: No, but...

Miss W.: Have you nothing better to speak of?

Marquis: Yes; do you love me?

Miss W.: I ought not.

Marquis: Why not?

Miss W.: Because, though but an actress, I love my country, and should not love her enemy.

Marquis: You can make me love her.

Miss W.: Indeed! This treaty that you promised Lord Schemer, which is yet unsigned, I hear.

Marquis: Ah! Those eyes of yours.

Miss W.: [Aside.] They'll do it, I see! [Aloud.] Who has delayed the completion—you?

Marquis: Yes.

Miss W.: And you close with Holland?

Marquis: That's true.

Miss W.: When you could...

Marquis: How's this? You surely are not here to talk politics. Come, leave such subjects to old heads. Do you be the loveliest of women—I the most adoring of men.

Miss W.: [Aside.] What shall I do? 

Enter WAITER, L.

Waiter: Baron von Stulph.

Miss W.: [Aside.] Thank Heaven!

Marquis: The devil!

Miss W.: Let him wait. [Exit Waiter.] What do you fear?

Marquis: Are you not aware that all those rascally newspapers attack me on the score of my youth, declaring my incapacity to govern, and lashing me for my intrigues and devotion to the sex?

Miss W.: What a calumny! Then I will meet the Baron while you escape.

[Exit C. ( -M-XKW ”• VZ4* VJU.WU QXUV.]

Marquis: Escape! Abandon the field, and so... [They change.] You have the Mar- 

to this Dutchman! Forbid it, Venus! Where shall I hide? This cabinet... [Opens the closet.]

Mere: (Who has been watching him.) Hold!

Marquis: What's that?

Mere: A jealous lover.

Marquis: Let me pass.

Mere: Never with life!

Marquis: I swear...

Mere: And so do I, in good English—damned if you stir a peg!

Marquis: Fool! I am a minist—that is, a manager. [Noise on stairs. Aside.] They come! The devil, what's to be done? I have it. [Lifts up Merestick and puts him in the closet; locks the door.] I hope he will not be stifled—I should.
Now to conceal myself. Ah! (Enters D. L. H.)

[Enter STULPH and MISS WOFFINGTON, c.]

Stulph: What are you afraid of? Is not your husband gone out?

Miss W.: Yes. (Aside) He has escaped.

Stulph: I am infuriated, exasperated, fear an apoplectic fit!

Miss W.: Who has angered you?

Stulph: That puppy of a Marquis.

Miss W.: (Aside) If he only could hear! (The closet door shakes.) Aha, he’s there. (Aloud) Sit down. (As she passes the cabinet door, R. h., and taking out the key.) Don’t lose a word, Marquis. (Aloud) So you (damn! caracco! (Aside) What the devil has he done?

Miss W.: My dear George, thank Heaven you are come!

Stulph: I appointed an interview at his house, and would you believe it, he was not at home, the impudent ass! Confound him!

Miss W.: What?

(Drawing chair near cabinet.)

Stulph: I said confound him!

(Following her.)

Miss W.: No, before that!

Stulph: Impudent ass!

Miss W.: Oh! (Aloud) Impudent ass! But is he not a man of genius?

Stulph:

Miss W.:

Stulph: Genius! Pooh!

Wit?

(Drawing chair near cabinet. Marquis listening from time to time, D. L.)

Ha! Ha!

(Following her.)

Miss W.: The most celebrated diplomatist in Europe!

Stulph: I could turn him round my finger.

Miss W.: You could turn him round your finger? (Chair again.)

Stulph: Yes; are you deaf?

Miss W.: On that side. Change places with me. (Chair again.)

Stulph: Completely.

Miss W.: He cannot escape. (Again.)

Stulph: I defy him.

Miss W.: But should he refuse to sign the treaty?

Stulph: He dare not. I'll sign, then, with England. (The Marquis is seen listening.)

Miss W.: You will what? Speak out like a man!

Stulph: Defy France, and sign with England. But come, my little angel---

Miss W.: Hush! Someone comes.

Tarleton: (Without) I say I will enter!

Miss W.: Oh! We’re lost!

Stulph: Who is it?

Miss W.: My husband.

Stulph: The devil! Where shall I go? (Running from door to door.)

Miss W.: He will kill you on the spot! Stay; you must play a part.

Stulph: An ambassador?

Miss W.: Or play a part.

Stulph: Of course; it is natural to him. Storm, rage, swear, draw your sword—make haste!

[Enter TARLETON.]

Tarleton: I will come in.

Miss W.: Sir, I assure you on my honour you are mistaken. (Aside to Stulph) Swear, damn it, in any language you know.

Tarleton: Who is this?

Stulph: Ventre bleu! donner and blitzen!

DO YOU MAKE TO ALL THIS?

Miss W.: Ha! ha! ha! Don't you see that little fool is tipsy?

Mere.: Tipsy! Oh! And I have only had two damned roasted apples since I entered this infernal country.

Tarleton: The-- Dutchman dies!

Mere.: The other is somewhere here.

Tarleton: I see that! (Seizing Mere.) Where is he?

Mere.: Murder!

Miss W.: (Stopping him.) George, desist; your fate depends upon it!

Tarleton: Never, false one!

Mere.: Never, false one, never!

Tarleton: This room-------

Miss W.: I'll never see you again!

Mere.: I dare do all. (Opens the door and runs to the other side of the stage.) There, now it's your business. (To Tarleton.)

[Enter the Marquis.]

Tarleton: So, now, madam!

Mere.: Now, madam!

Marquis.: So--hum--that rascally Baron, he'll twist me round his finger, will he?

Miss W.: He called you an impudent ass.

Marquis.: Oh, yes! I heard him.

Mere.: So did I. Ass was the word.

Miss W.: Triton, be quiet.

Tarleton: Sir, a word with you. (Half aside to Marquis.)

Marquis.: In a moment. (To Miss Woongton.) You know the secret envoy from London?

Miss W.: He is in this house.

Tarleton: You must explain, sir. (Half aside to Marquis.)

Marquis.: An instant. Has he signed the treaty?

Mere.: (To Tarleton.) Give it him.

Miss W.: You will find it on that table. I will explain more when you have signed it.

Marquis.: Ha! So now, Baron, will you twist me round your finger.

Mere.: (To Tarleton.) Why don't you knock him down?

Miss W.: Ah, Triton! Permit me, Marquis, to present to you Mr. George Tarleton, His Britannic Majesty's Charge d'Affaires.

Marquis.: How!

Tarleton: The devil!

Mere.: Oh, she's mad--raging mad!

Marquis.: You appointed the Baron to come here?

Miss W.: That he might betray his real character before you.

Tarleton: Explain this, sir.

Stulph: Explain, sir! Explain! Damn 'sacre! Corpo di Bacco! Der Teufel!

Miss W.: He cannot speak for rage. This gentleman suddenly rushed into my room, sword in hand, as you see, swearing, as you hear--told me I know not what. He had surprised his wife with some young lover.

Stulph: Tonnerre de Dien! Confound! (Aside.) She lies like a statesman.

Miss W.: The lover escapes and takes refuge in this hotel.

Stulph: Ha! ha! Capital! Ha! (Recollecting himself.) Tete bleu! Ventre St. Gris!

Miss W.: I do assure you, sir, you are mistaken.

Tarleton: Sir, I beg of you to be appeased, and request you to withdraw.

Stulph: At the desire of so lovely a woman as that, permit me to apologize to-- (Aside.) What a delicious intrigue! (Aloud.) I go. Accept my excuses. (Aside.) She is full of genius. (Aloud.) I have the honour-- (Aside.) Ha! ha! ha! We've done him; in fact, we are both full of genius!

[Exit, c.]

Miss W.: (Aside.) Now for the Minister! (Aloud.) Well, George, is it not odd?

Tarleton: Very.

Miss W.: You doubt it?

Tarleton: No; but where's the lover?
MISS W.: Hush! Still here.

TARLETON: Nonsense!

MISS W.: "Poor devil! I pitied, I concealed him."

TARLETON: Always good-natured. But where is he?

MISS W.: In that closet. (Aside) Lord! how easily are men deceived!

TARLETON: Poor wretch! He must be half-smothered. (Opens the door, McrestiektumUes in.) Hollo!

MISS W.: Jerry, as I'm a sinner!

MERE: Air! Water! I'm dead! Open the windows!

MISS W.: I left him in London, in my dressing-room, and find him in Paris in my cupboard. (Aside) But where the deuce, then, is the Marquis?

TARLETON: The stranger.

MERE: Oh, sir, we are both deceived by that wretched woman.

MISS W.: Ha! ha! ha!

MERE: You shall know all and be revenged. You have courage and can fight for both of us. That fat fellow was no more a husband than you or I.

TARLETON: No!

MISS W.: Ha! ha! ha!

MERE: No; it was the Dutchman—the damned cheesemonger!

MARQUIS: And this rage against Stulph?

MISS W.: Only to send him away.

MARQUIS: My dear sir, I congratulate you. The tact and address you have exhibited shall not go unrewarded by your Ministry.

TARLETON: My Ministry?

MARQUIS: You are the best diplomatist I ever knew!

MISS W.: (Aside) Considering he knew nothing about it.

MERE: Oh, they've done him between 'em.

TARLETON: Really, sir, I don't understand.

MARQUIS: No apologies, I beg.

TARLETON: Allow me to explain.

MARQUIS: I know all.

MISS W.: His lordship knows all.

MERE: I wish I did.

TARLETON: His lordship. I am in a dream.

MERE: I shall never be wide awake again.

MARQUIS: And who is this little man?

MISS W.: The Royal Courier, awaiting the signature of your lordship.

MARQUIS: 'Tis done. M. le Charge d'Affaires. (Tarleton does not reply.) M. le Charge d'Affaires?

[Miss Woffington touches him.]

TARLETON: Oh, yes.

MARQUIS: You have your letters?

TARLETON: My letters?

MISS W.: Yes, my lord, they are here. (She offers them.)

MARQUIS: Good.

TARLETON: Good?

MERE: Oh, super-excellent! She's a witch. Now she's done the Minister!

MARQUIS: There, the treaty is concluded. Consider yourself a Baronet.

Enter STULPH, 0.

TARLETON: My lord, I...

MISS W.: (To Tarleton) Quick! Sign the paper! Compare Lord Schemer, No. 3.

TARLETON: Ah, I see. Then No. 7. (Looking at Marquis.)

MISS W.: The Marquis.

STULPH: The Minister.

MISS W.: Nought in propria persona.

MARQUIS: The Ambassador.

STULPH: My lord, I waited at your residence, but hearing you were here, I...

MARQUIS: Yes, Baron; and I waited because you were here.

STULPH: The treaty...

MARQUIS: Have you read, Mr. Tarleton?

TARLETON: Yes, and signed it. (Aside) It may be my death warrant for what I know.

STULPH: Tarleton!
