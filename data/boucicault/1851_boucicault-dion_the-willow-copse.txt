ACT I.

Scene I — Exterior of a country Inn on the outskirts of Fielking's Farm. Inn on the left with a sign—" The Old Falcon." Wood on the right.

Music.

Staggers (outside).

That's the way, young man — that's the way; rub her down well. (Enters stage right.)

Rub her down well! I'll back that little mare against anything that runs on four legs, and carries a tail. Fourteen miles in fifty-three minutes—never broke her trot, or turned a hair, and I'm eighteen stone avoirdupois, if I'm a blessed ounce. Ha! here's the Old Falcon, and I am as hungry as a whole pack of hounds. What shall I order? (Calls) Ho! waiter!

Enter Timn, stage left in flat.

Dinner for three and brandy and water for six, that's the style, — live like a coronation coachman, and die like a blue rock. Not a word from you.

Enter Hulks (smoking) from Inn, left hand door, right.

Hulks. Not a word from you! I should know that voice.

Staggers (Aside). Oho! who's here? I wonder if I could sell the mare to him? (Aloud) Good morning, sir—fine day, very. Are you any judge of horse-flesh, sir?

Hulks. I ought to be, Master Bill Staggers.

Staggers. Bill! — eh — what — no. It can't be Dick ——

THE WILLOW COPSE [ACT I]

Hulks. Hush! (Looks around)

Staggers. Not a word from you; never mind — make no noise!

Hulks. You little thought to meet me here. Do you remember how we parted?

Staggers. At the quarter sessions — you were in the dock, and I was in the box. (Sings) "O, the moment was sad when my Dick and I parted!"

Hulks. But you are looking uncommon well.

Staggers. Ay! I had a thriving business in Norwich, as an attorney, till that fatal affair into which you drew me—

Hulks. I, Dick? My dear Dick, I was a baby in your hands.

Staggers. Yes. You, who turned queen's evidence, convicted me, and caused me to be struck off the rolls.

Hulks. Struck! — hit 'em again, Dick — hit 'em again. But tell me, what brings you into this part of the country?

Staggers. I'll tell you — ha! — I've come after a legacy.

Hulks. No! A legacy, my dear Dick! Have you dined?

Staggers. Before I was an attorney, I was articled to a firm in Lynn. My master was solicitor to Sir William Vaughan.

Hulks. The Squire who died last year, and who owned this estate?

Staggers. (Left) Sir William had an only son, whose conduct, it seems, displeased the old gentleman; for a month before his death he cut off his heir with a shilling.

Hulks. Cut off his hair with a shilling! What a rum old shaver!

Staggers. No. His son and heir. Well, my master and I took the will to the baronet to be executed. I was one witness to it — my master was the other. After it was signed, the old baronet concealed the document.

Staggers. Where?

Hulks. That's my secret. A fortnight after this, my master dies, and, not long after, the baronet follows him.
Staff: But how came it, then, that young Sir Richard is in possession?

Hui: Hush! The news of that fact brought me down here.

Staff: Oho! But if he should be fool enough to do the right thing and vacate--

Hui: My dear Bill, if you had ever enjoyed the facility my profession afforded me of studying human nature, you would perceive absurdity of your "If."

Stag: Who, then, does the estate goto?

Hui: To Luke Fielding, an old friend and tenant of Sir William's. He little dreams that he is the rightful owner of these broad acres; so, mind ye, I have already made my court to the girl, but I want the means to cut a dash and dwle her into compliance. I must frighten this youngster, Sir Richard, out of a round sum of money, which I will spend in gaining the heiress.

Stag: But what am I to do? Can't I do something or somebody?

Hui: For, look ye, either the young baronet has discovered the will and destroyed it, or it is still in its hiding-place.

Stag: Well?

Hui: If, as I suspect, it is still concealed, we must have it.

Stag: But--but how?

Hui: The short way--take it! (Aside.) He smiles; curse him, he means mischief! (Aloud.) Oh, I forgot to mention a little matter.

Stag: What is it, my dear boy?

Hui: That if you again double on me, I shall wait upon you at a convenient moment, and blow your brains out.

Stag: My dear Dick, now to show you wrong your Bill, observe me. I picked up a gent on the road as I came along, the tenderest chicken. If I am not greatly mistaken, the dear boy has been flirting with the police. I will elevate him with a bottle of the Old Falcon champagne, which will enter his heart like an oyster's knife, and display his feelings.

Hui: Be it so; manage it as you will; promise him what you like, but leave me.

Stag: Not a word from ye!

Hui: In--to the house. I see someone coming. (Crosses over.)

I would speak with, and we must not be seen much together.

Stag: Make no noise.

Hui: Away!

Stag: I'm sloping! (Exit into house. H. Hulkt R. looking L.)

Bill: 'Tis she!--It must be. Yes, it is Rose Fielding--my Rose. But who is that with her? A gentleman, it seems. He keeps his head down; now they talk! Both: Hush! (They approach window R.)

Richard, the young baronet. Ha! Can he have seen the will, and knows his fortune can be saved by a marriage with this girl? He has doubled on me. (Retires behind and disappears. Cut Wood, as Rose and Sir Richard enter, L.)

Sir H: My dear Roee, is not my word, my pledged and sacred word, to be relied upon?
Hom: Ah, Richard ' but that word you gave me months ago, and still it is unredeemed. Ah! I trusted you with all -- all -- my life, honor. You found me happy and contented, my Cither's pride. What would he say if he knew that his Rose had withered, was blighted, and by you, you, Richard, the toon of his oldest friend?
Sir H: Rose, do not reproach me!
Roee: I do not; but I cannot meet my father's face, beaming with such honest confidence and love. Ah, Richard! Why has that love turned to poison tome? Why do I shrink from his embrace? Why does his blessing seem a curse?
Sir JR: Hush, dearest Rose, I implore you! The marriage I promised shall be solemnized at once.
Hom: Will you, Richard -- will you; and I shall be yours -- your wife?
Sir R: What sacrifice would I not make for your sake?
Roee: Yes, I know, and I am grateful, very grateful. You are noble and rich; I am not your equal; and if I do ask you, Richard, to redeem your word, it is not only for my sake, but my father's -- my deceived --
Sir R: Hush! Have I not promised you shall be mine?
Roee: Yes. I believe you, for why should you deceive me now?
Sir R: Let us part, then, dear Rose. Confide in me -- farewell!
Roee: Farewell! And tonight at the Willow Copse. (Crosses to L.H.)
Sir R: We meet again. Farewell! (Exit Roee, L.H.)
Yes, my resolution is fixed. I will no longer lead this life of remorse. One crime is burden enough to bear through life. How bitterly do I repent these follies of my youth, when my revolt against my poor Arthur induced him to write to me that terrible letter, where he declared I should not succeed to his estates! It must have been a threat; for, when I hurried home, on receiving the news of his sudden death, I found no will, no claimant. Unexamined I burnt all the papers I could find; I dared not look at them; yet the will may still exist. The thought pursues me -- haunts me. I live in dread that every hour may wrest from me my home. Each new fire I meet at every turn -- (Turns and finds himself face to face with Hulks, who is smoking a pipe, and has lounged down the stage, L.H.F.)
Hui: Morning, Sir Richard.
Sir R: Your servant, sir. (Aside.) Who is this fellow?
Hui: Stay, sir -- a word if you please.
Sir R: Let me pass, fellow! If you would provoke my charity, spare your invention. There is a shilling.
Hui: Charity? No, Sir Richard, it is another matter I have to settle with you.
Sir R: Sir!
Hui: I saw you addressing Rose Fielding.
Sir R: Silence! Dare you pollute her name!
Hui: You know, sir, she is beneath you; you can mean her no good.
Sir R: Who are you, sir, that dare to cross me in my path; and what has Miss Fielding in common with you?
Hui: This. I love her -- would marry her.
Sir R: You -- you marry her!
And think you I would yield her to such as you?

Hui. And what are you better than a felon?

Sir R. Miscreant!

Hui. Be discreet, Sir Richard. Crime is a leveller of all distinctions. You are a magistrate.

Sir R. This is no place, sir.

Hui. It won't take you a minute.

Sir R. I am occupied.

Hui. It is about a will -- a concealed will.

Sir R. Ha! -- A will? Whose will?

Hui. Sir William Vaughan's.

Sir R. Ha!

Hui. Executed just before his death. The one which you destroyed.

Sir A. 'Tis false! I only burned those papers found in my father’s study. I -- I -- did not examine what they were.

Hui. (Aside.) He has not discovered it! Come, come, baronet, I have all the proofs. I am the only living witness to that will. Now, all I want is an outfit for California.

Sir J. If I accept your terms, what assurance have I of your silence?

Hui. The best. By that very silence I participate in your crime.

Sir R. My crime!

Hui. Yes, Sir Richard. Now I'll warrant you would marry Rose Fielding. You hesitated when you thought yourself her superior; but now that you are degraded by crime, you think it would prove an atonement for the past. There is your picture, baronet; how do you like it? No man knows himself till he is found out by somebody else.

Sir R. (Hesitatingly.) You know she loves me.

Hui. I do. Be generous for once. Save her from yourself.

Sir R. What excuse can I give?

Hui. The worse the better; she'll forget you the sooner.

Sir R. He is right. Our union would but consummate her ruin and my own; she is lost to me forever. Yes, yes, I will throw myself at her feet, own the fatal truth, implore her pardon, and leave this spot forever.

Hui. Well resolved. To-night, then.

Sir R. To-night!

Hui. There is a wood that skirts a stream in the bottom. I know not how you call it.

Sir R. The Willow Copse.

Hui. To-night, then, at eleven. I'll meet you there.

(Exit Sir Richard, R. H. 2 E. Hulks into the Inn, U H. in R.)

Scene II. -- The interior of Willow Farm -- Staircase, U H. C. -- Door, B. H. in flat. -- Window latticed, L. -- Large fireplace, U H. -- Table and large oak chair, U B. -- Cupboard, C., with dinner-things.

Music.

Enter Rose, R. N. D.

Rose. How bright the day is, and how happy all seemed to be when I crossed the meadows! Ah! it was my heart that sent its light to everything around me, dear Richard. But I must not let my joy make me forget all I have to do. Bless me, how late it is, and my father’s dinner is not thought of yet!
I must get Meg to help me. (Cats.) Meg! Meg!

(Meg, without, no header in right)

Meg: Yes, Miss-ees.

Bose: Where are you?

Meg: (Without,) I be along with the cows in the stable.

Rose: I want you.

(Without) Can’t come, miss. Janet be milking the kicking cow, and I be holdin’ on by ’y tail.

Rose: No matter — come.

Meg: Very well, I’m coming. Hoy-oy-oy! I told ye how it would be. She ha kicked over the pail. Haye! — ye—wicked one—ye——

Rote: Quick, Meg. (Meg enters by the door)

Meg: Heh! It's main hot, to be sure.

Rose: Place the table, Meg, there’s a good girl — and my Other’s dinner.

Meg: All a roastin’; ’it’s that bad-tempered turkey-cock.

Rose: What is?

Meg: Why, the dinner, if he be as hard to eat as he was to catch, I’d as lief have bread aad oheaw.

(Ltm is heard outside window, no header)

Meg: Thank ye, kindly; thank ye.

Rose: My father’s voice.

Meg: Ees; hark how thpcowa is a rambling and tearing! They know master Luke’s voice as well—-

Luke: (Outside.) Take the nag, Joe; I’ll send you out a stoopst the old ala. My lads* thankee alt. (Enter as if from riding, D. in p.)

Luke: Ah! My 6ose, my bud, there’s the last load o’ wheat slacked and in; the lads have worked like horses, and are dry as hay. Meg, lass, out with a barrel of the old Christmas ale; it’s been a hard day, but it’s over, and with it ends a glorious season. Heaven’s mercy be praised for it! And now I think I’ve earned a kiss, eh?

ACT 1

(Hs tits— Rose hat tah:n hit hat and whip, Meg having ad vanetd chair — Rose kitset him.)

Rose: From five this morning until now, it is too hard work; I will not allow it.

Luke: Too hard, eh? Ought not I to be thankful for the strength I have, and that there’s work for me, and for all? It was a feast for me when, sitting beneath a hedge, eating the breakfast you sent me, I watched a score of sturdy arms at work in a golden sea of wheat, above which laughed as many brown faces. My heart rose up like a sky-lark on the wing, for, when the brave sickle sheared through the straw, I thought I saw want cut down at every sweep, and every sheaf they bound, it seemed as if they fettered down a human misery.

(Meg brings a mug of ale and glass.)

Meg: Lor, if your talk be’ant as fine as the Lon’on mister!

(Meg places a large table, un., by Luke — Goes to a large cupboard in the 0., brings table-cloth, plates, knife, fork, etc.; at the scene goes on, places plates to the fireplace, L. H.)

Luke: The Lon’on mister! Who’s he?

Meg: He as lives up at tho Old Falcon.

Luke: A foreign-looking fellow, eh?

Meg: Dessay he be, for he go onin an outlandish way.
LUKE: Meg, be advised—this fellow can mean you no good. Ton are an honest girl, and he will only deceive you.

MEG: Fes, master, he will.

LUKE: And remember, I have no pity for her who can disgrace and bring to shame the name she bears, however humble.

MEG: What’s the matter with Miss Rose?

LUKE: There be no distinction in virtue, and you are as honest as a duchess.

MEG: Lord—my—be I now, doan’t ’ee say so!

LUKE: For look ye, Meg! Crime is the only thing that’s stronger than a man; and when that gets the better of him, he’s a coward for his life and a coward may put a stone about his neck, and leave his place to be filled by a better man. Were ye my own child, I had rather see ye dead than dishonest.

[Rose appears faint, and scarcely able to stand.]

MEG: Look — Miss Rose, she’s fainting.

LUKE: Bow!

ROSE: Nothing, father—nothing.

[Joseph puts his head in at the door, B. H. in R.]

JOSEPH: Master, here be a whole drove of gentlefolk come to ask you for your vote for the new parliament-man.

LUKE: The canvassing-party. Show ’em in, Joe, whoever they be. How pale you are, Rose! (Exit Joe.) And you tremble, too. Sit ye down there—there. (Rose draws back the chair and sits, Z. H.) Now, Meg, say Luke Fielding will see the gentry that honor his poor form.

[Meg runs to the door on Colonel Vanguard, Fungus, Bubblemere, Lucy Vanguard and Arthur appear at B. H. D. in R.]

ARTHUR: I come, Mr. Fielding, to solicit your vote in my election, and my friend Colonel Vanguard.

LUKE: Vanguard! What, Cornel! Why, I’m glad to see you.

COLONEL: I knew you would be, my dear Luke.

LUKE: And Lucy, too! Lucy, why, I thought you had forgotten Willow Farm.

LUCY: Forgotten you, Luke!

LUKE: No, and. (Aside to her.) I’ve heard of it all; I forgive your absence. (Looks at Arthur.) I hope he is as good as he looks. There, don’t blush! (Goes up with Lucy, B. C.)

COLONEL: (Kissing Rose.) And my little rose-bud, so, and you would not come up to see me at the Manor House, eh? though you knew I was laid up on my back like a turtle.

LUKE: (Down B. C.) Why, you see, Cornel,—you’ll forgive me, but we have a little bit of pride,—we heard Sir Richard had a party of fine folks on a visit (Rose embraces Lucy.) Now, I’m but a farmer; I know that, as a laboring man, I’m not fit company.

COLONEL: Luke!

[Arthur, Rose and Lucy speak apart, B. H. C.]

LUKE: Nay, I know it well, Rose would not go without me, and so----

COLONEL: And so for a bit of pride, you left your own friend, Ralph Vanguard, to swear at his own bootjack.

BUBBLEMERE: (L. H.) And is it possible that this hole of a place gives a vote?
Cal. There's not a farmer or cottager for ten miles around, who would pledge his vote till he sees where Luke Kidding writes his name.

Luke. Writes his name! No, Baph, I wish I could. Makes his mark, you mean.

Fungut. [Down L.B.] What, can't you write!

Luke. No, dr—nor read!

Bui. And yet he returns a member.

Luke. Hum! What says Miss Lucy?

Lucy. I, Luke? I say, if he is not an M. p. to-morrow night, I new speak to you again.

Luke. Ah! Intimidation!

Lucy. And if he is, I'll kiss you twenty times.

Luke. Bribery! Bribery!

Enter Lady Apslet, followed by Miss Apsurr and Georgina, 0.

D. R. H. X.

LadyA. Who's that, promising to kiss twenty times?

Lucy. I did, Lady Apsley. [Crosses to L.H.] Allow me to present to you Mr. Luke, my god-father, after whom I was called Lucy.

ArtA My mother, Lady Apsley, and my sisters.

Luke. Proud to see you—and as far the errand you come on, ladies----

Lady A. Come on an errand!

Georg. 0! what a vulgar old thing!

Lucy. Hush! [Aside to Georgina.] This is his daughter.

Georg. A farmer's daughter! [Goes up.C.]

Lucy. And my friend.

Luke. I do believe the young man is honest.

Lady A. Honest! Do you take him for a domestic, sir, that you question his honesty? Honest! I never heard such a term applied to a gentleman!

Luke. Shall I beg his pardon for it, ma'am?

Lady A. No, no; never mind—there's a good man. Vote, and that's all; and excuse my haste, for, really, I hate a farm-yard.

[All retire up but Luke and Colonel Vanguard.]

Col. [Crosses to C.] You must accompany me to Lynn today, so that your vote may be published early tomorrow. No refusal.

Luke. Will Bose let me go, di? Leave her for two whole days?

Arth. [Aside, coming down of Lady Apswy.] I thank you, Mr. Fielding. Pray, [Aside to Lady A.] Mother, say something.

Lady A. Oh, must I? Dear me, well. Mr.—a—a—you are very good. If we can serve you—most happy—rely on my exertions. Good-morning, Mr.—a—a—Colonel, your arm.

Col. No, no—I'll not let Luke escape me; he is too great a prize. Luke, her ladyship awaits you.

[Luke crosses to Lady A., and offers his arm.]

Luke. Come, madam, I'll show you out with much pleasure.

[Exit with Lady A., L.H.D.R.]

Col. Rose, I am going to run away with him till tomorrow. Good-by. [Kisses her, and exit, R.H.D.R.]

Bui. [Offering his arm to Georgina.] What a horrid boor, and that great animal votes.
Georg: Look at his daughter -- dressed like a lady.
Bub: 'Tis horrible! {Exit, R. h. d. f.)
Fung: {Accompanying Miss Apsley.) I wonder where these sort of people sleep!
Miss A.: In the stables.
Fung: Savages! dreadful savages! {Exit with Miss A.,*, d. f.)
Arth: Miss Fielding, I fear I must apologize for my mother and my sisters; but you must not judge them hastily.
Bose: It will be sufficient for me that they are friends of Lucy's.
Lucy: Arthur, spare me a few moments with Rose. I will follow you.
Arth: I will wait for you. {Exit, c. d.)
Lucy: {Hastily.) My dearest Rose, what mean these pale looks? why are you changed? Tell me, Rose; I know there is something.
Bose: No, Lucy. It is -- you will soon know, but I cannot --
Lucy: Have we lived all our lives without a secret from each other, and are you to begin now?
Bose: Forgive me, do! I am sure you will when I tell you all; but the secret is not mine. Tomorrow, perhaps, you will know more; be satisfied. I am happy, indeed I am.
Lucy: I must believe you, for you never deceived me; and I am happy, Rom, how happy! Arthur loves me, as some day someone will love you. (Arthur at the window.)
Arth: Lucy?
Lucy: I am coming. (Kisses Rose.) Goodbye, dear Rose. (Runs out, d. r. b.)
Rose: They love each other, and how happy she appears! and so am I! O! the future owes me a long dream of Joy, for the past has been very wretched. How I will love him! how proud I will be to bear his name, to be his, to live beneath the same roof, to look on him without shame, to think on him without sorrow! Dear Richard, my heart trembles, when I think how near is the hour of my bliss.
Enter Sir Richard, pale and agitated, through private door, B. 2 E.
Sir R.: Rose!
Rose: Richard, how pale you are!
Sir R.: Are you alone?
Rose: Alone! Yes. What has happened?
Sir R.: I come to plead -- to entreat -- to----
Rose: Richard, something has happened! You tremble and turn from me!
Sir R.: (Aside.) How can I tell her!
Rose: Let me know it -- am I not your wife?
Sir R.: 'Tis that -- that -- Rose, our marriage is the signal of my ruin!
Rose: Your ruin!
Sir R.: Rose, would you plight your faith to one who is lost -- forever a beggar?
Rose: I would share with you the bitterest cup that misery could pour. I would cheat you of your share of want, and think I feasted. If I took from you a single pain--
Sir R.: Rose, Rose -- spare me! If you knew all, you would despise me!
Rose: What have you done?
Sir R.: If 'twere but poverty -- but I have --
Row: Speak -- speak!
Sb R.: I offer you a name dishonored and disgraced!
Rose: And what am I? what do I bring to you? If you have sinned, am I innocent! Richard, I do not care what your guilt is, if it be not dishonor.
ACT I

Sir R. Rose, hear me! My guilt is deeper than you think! I am in the power of wretches, who can compel me to any sacrifice! I dare not brave my fate!

Rose. You torture me! What— what have you done?

Sir R. I am one whose liberty, whose liberty for life, is at stake! At any moment, the ministers of the law may cast me in a loathsome cell, to leave it for the felon's doom!

Rose. (Sinks into his arms.) No, no, Richard!

Sir R. Hush, Rose! Rose, look up—listen! She faints! Wretch that I am, not to tell her! Rose, speak to me! I will brave all—you shall be mine! I will restore you to honor, if by the deed, I lose my life! (Places her in chair.)

(Hulks enters n. d. in r.)

Hulks. Nonsense; you will do nothing of the sort. Don't spoil what you have done so well. (Music.) Come!

Sir R. Amy, wretch! Ruffian! I have killed her!

Hulks. Humbug! Come along.

Sir R. Forgive me— Rose— Rose— Rose!

Hulks. (Dragging Sir R. away from Rose.) Come!

Curtain.

ACT II

Music.

Scene — The Old Falcon. Augustus enters from the Inn, L. H. d. in r. Laughing within.

Augustus. Bravo! What first-rate gents! tip-top, especially the sporting character. To hear him talk, makes your very hair stand on end. Ecod! he seems to know everybody. I came it strong, too, occasionally, and talked of Lady Evelina and Lady Arabella. At last I slipped out the name of the Countess, Leontine-de-Cadeau, pat. Damned if he hadn't her address at once! Foley-Place, and a Footman in green; a trip— ah! it was a trip—when she came to our shop in Piccadilly; such a complexion, and ringlets to her waist; the agility I displayed in tumbling over the whole Mock; the eyes I made, the blushes I bestowed! At last I poured out my passion over a box of ribbons. She listened; I urged; she consents. I rob the till, and throw my fortune at her feet. We fly to Margate—delicious moments! Up to the last ten pounds, with which vanished, the heartless Leontine left me a note containing this (Looks round cautiously) this bill. (draws out a hand-bill from a green bag, and reads)— "Absconded, a young man named Joseph Twill, charged with embezzling various sums from his employers. He—is—of insignificant appearance,—nose singularly snubbed,— (my nose snubbed! Leontine said it was Dutch, high Dutch)—no chip visible, and a cast in his eye; light hair, and a plum-colored paletot."
Ha, ha, I've done them there -- thanks to a patent black dye, and an old clothes-man! I am just the reverse -- light paletot and plum-colored hair.

[Enter Hulks, flat back from B. h. 1 x. Meeting Staggers, who comes from the Inn, l. h. d. f.]

"Whoever will give any information that may lead to the detection of the said Joseph Twill, will receive forty shillings reward."

Forty shillings! Humiliating amount! Am I worth no more than a stray poodle? I suppose it's all right.

Hulks: As a trivet.

Aug: [Thrusts the bill into his pocket.] Heh!

Stag: Ha! Ha! Ha!

Aug: He! He!

Hulks: Ha! Ha! I beg your pardon, sir, but there was a couple of gents asking after you.

Aug: Me!

Hulks: They had your description.

Aug: Impossible! I'm not a bit like it; 't isn't me!

Hulks: They asked where you were. I thought I might as well --

Aug: Claim the reward! Oh Lord!

Hulks: Bill?

Stag: Never holloa.

Hulks: It's all right.

SOEBI L] THS WILLOW COMB. 21

Aug: Gentlemen, I assure you I'm the victim of a conspiracy; I'm highly connected -- damned high. This charge is trumped up!

Hulks: Look ye; you are known. We can save ye; no nonsense with us. Come, the truth.

Aug: What truth? I -- I -- when I left off business, I retired rather suddenly with my share of the profits.

Hulks: Hem! -- Much!

Aug: Fifty.

Hulks: Fifty! Hum -- bad -- low -- devilish low!

Stag: Damned low!

Hulks: Six months.

Stag: Eighteen.

Hulks: Six -- first offence.

Aug: Lord! Gents, gents -- don't -- don't -- don't desert me, gents! Is there nothing you can point out -- eh?

Hulks: Restore the money; a repentant letter; five pounds to the poor-box at Bow-street.

Aug: Yes; but where is the money to be had?

Stag: I'll just explain our speculation through a bottle of Port. [Links his arm in that of Augustus.]

Hulks: Confide yourself to us. [Links his arm in that of Augustus.]

Stag: Halloa! Waiter!

[Enter Waiter, l. d. r.]

Aug: By Jove! Ah! Waiter, a bottle of Port. I say, will you pay for it till I hear from home?

Stag: Not a word from ye.

Hulks: Will you take a thousand for your share of the profits?

Aug: A thousand pounds! Well, I don't mind.

Stag: A thousand! Come, Dick, don't cheat our dear boy. Why, I would give him fifteen hundred pounds down.

Aug: Fifteen hundred! Have you got the money, now?

Hulks: Mind your own business, Mr. Staggers.

Stag: Waiter, the Port.

Hulks: [To Aug.] Take my advice.

Stag: Don't -- he'll charge you six shillings and eight pence. Brit-r-ha! Ha!

Aug: Ha! Ha!
ACT II

Scene I

(Staggers draws Augustus into the house. Hulks follows, L.H.D.R.)

Enter Colonel and Luke, S.H.2.L.

Col. Now for the campaign. We will sleep at Lynn.

Enter Lucy, S.H.2.E.

Lucy. All is ready, papa; the carriage is at the door.

Luke. I shan't mind the ride, for a distant relation of mine, old John Fielding, is dangerously ill; he lives on the road, so a call. And the doctor does say he's condemned, poor fellow! He's a poor man, and the widow may want a pound or two, and a shake of the hand.

Lucy. I sent down to the farm for all you may require; you will find it in the carriage.

(Meg outside, A.H.11)

Meg. Where is he — where's my master? Where's Master Luke?

Luke. Meg—dang that wench!—what be she come after?

Enter Meg breathless, A.H.11

Meg. Oof! Eh! Master, I've got ye!

Luke. What is it?

Meg. Stop a bit, till—I'm—so—oof—Miss — Miss Rose!

Luke. What of her?—quick!

Meg. I don't know; but when I went in after you'd gone, I found her in such a taking—crying—crying!

Luke. Rose crying!—my child!

Meg. And as white as a sixpence. I asked her what it was. "Meg," says she, "give that letter to my father, on his return."

Luke. A letter! ....

Meg. Here it is. (Produces the written letter.)

Luke. Why, she knows I can't read. What's the use o' writing to me? Lucy, will you just see what it is?

Lucy. (Opening the letter she reads.) O, heavens!

Luke. Eh!

Meg. What!

Lucy. It is—it—is—n—nothing, Luke—nothing!

Luke. Nothing!

Lucy. (Reads again.) I'll tell you. (Aside.) Poor me—mercy—she cannot contemplate—

Luke. Come, read out!

Lucy. What can I tell him! Ah! (Aloud.) That relation you spoke of—he is worse—and—a—that is all.

Luke. (Takes the letter.) That is all!

Lucy. The news, it appears, arrived suddenly.

Luke. My poor Rose! I've a good mind to go back, now.

Col. Nonsense—Lucy can go.

Lucy. Yes, I will go at once. Give me the letter, Luke. (She takes the letter.)

(Lucy aside to Vanguabd, L.H.)

Lucy. Don't let Luke visit this relation he spoke of.

Col. (Aside.) How?—Why not?

Lucy. (Aside.) No matter; prevent it by any means. Good-by, Luke. (Crosses to R. Exit, IILH. Exit Vanguabd and Luke, L.H.I.L)

Meg. Humph! Well, it's my opinion Miss Lucy doesn't know much about reading... (Exit, R.H.I.L)
Scene IL - Organ music in this scene at opening.

Willow Copse, 4th grove. Music slow. Stage dark.

Enter Rose, 8 X. L. H.

Rose: How silently the stream glides on! Nothing is changed, and yet here, here it was, that I listened to the first vows of his love. This tree overshadowed us, and our forms were reflected in that river. Little did I think, then, I was seated on my grave, and gazing into my tomb. 0! Heaven will pity me! Richard, I forgive you—I love you still. May you be happy. (Kneeling beside the stream.) One prayer—not for myself—I dare not—but for my father—and for him— (Music.)

Enter Lucy, L. H. 8 E. Sees Rose, runs up to her and catches hold of her dress and exclaims, “Rose! Rose'"

Rose: Lucy! (Rises.)

Lucy: I have found you! Leave this spot! (Brings her forward, embracing her.)

Rose: Dearest Lucy!

Lucy: What would you do? What purpose brings you here? I knew it—I know all! O, Rose! (Weeps on her shoulder.)

Rose: The torments of hell are not keener than what I suffer. You know, then—my father has received my letter.

Lucy: No, here it is; take it. (Gives letter to Rose.) He is ignorant of its contents, believe me he is. When Meg brought it, and described your wretchedness, he asked me to read it to him.

Rose: Lucy, 'tis vain! I feel that I cheat my father of his affection. I cannot bear his caresses! They belong to what I was, not what I am.

Lucy: Hush, Rose! Tell me who is the wretch that has caused-----

Rose: Ah! he is not to blame.

Lucy: You love him still?

Rose: Better than my life.

Lucy: Trust me with his name.

Rose: I dare not.

Lucy: Rose, I implore you!

Rose: No; he shall never reproach me with betraying him.

Lucy: Has he not betrayed you?

Enter Sir Richard, L. H. 2 E.

Sir R.: Lucy!

Lucy: Sir Richard.

Rose: Ah! (Shrinks from him behind Lucy.)

Lucy: 'Tis he! 'Tis he, then!

Sir R.: Lucy! At this hour, and in such a place!

Lucy: The hour and the place befit the deed, sir. Pray assist me. Here is a poor creature whom I found kneeling beside that stream—another moment, and I had been too late to preserve her life!

Sir R.: A suicide! What can have driven her to such a deed?

Lucy: You best can tell. Look! (Passes Rose to Sir Richard.) (Sir Richard crosses to Rose.)

Sir R.: Rose, you here! And with such a purpose!

Rose: I—I—dared not live; my life is in your path. You told me so; and my father, this very day, he spoke my doom, when he said, "Were you my own child, I'd rather see you dead than dishonest!"

Sir R.: And think you I am base enough to accept this sacrifice? Would you crush me with remorse? O! live, Rose! Live for me! Spare your life, that I may atone for one fruitless year of misery! (Music.)
SCENE I. THE WILLOW CORSE.

Rose. Ah, Richard! Could I believe my life is precious to you--

Sir R. 0! You have cause to doubt it, Rose. I ask you to bear our secret for one week; but time for one effort more to escape the toils my own crime has woven round me. Then, by my honor and my love, I swear to you, I claim you as my wife.

Rose. Richard, let me owe it to your love, rather than to your honor. (Meg without, 2 B. B. H.)

Meg. Hie! Fangs, hie, lad!

Rose. Meg's voice.

Lucy. Let me accompany you to the form.

Rose. No, send Meg after me; she will be sufficient protection.

Sir R. Rose, remember, and trust in me.

Rose. Ah, Richard, in whom else can I trust? (Exit Rose, L. H.)

Meg. Hie on, hie on, steady! (Re-enter Meg, r. h. 2 e.)

Meg. She passed this way; Fangs is on her track. Heh! Wooh-ho-who-here's Sir Richard and Miss Lucy!

Sir R. Whom are you seeking, Meg?

Meg. Why, Miss Rose-hie, he's found her.

Sir R. Who?

Meg. Fangs-I know his yelp-that's he-it's all right.

Sir R. I will accompany you to the Manor, Lucy.

Lucy. But it is late, and if we enter together, it may appear strange.

Sir R. They will all have retired to rest when we arrive. I have the pass-key of the postern in the park.

Meg. There be some ugly fellows lurking about. I can tell 'ee. Fangs has been a growlin' like thunder.

Sir R. Come, Lucy. (Exit Sir Richard and Lucy, r. h. 2 e.)

Meg. Hum! That's queer. I don't like it all. Fust Miss Rose, and then Miss Lucy. He cannot-'em both. 'Tis my opinion the landlord's a-hum! Well, I '11 just run after Fangs, see Miss Rose safe housed, and then I 'll cut across to the Manor House. There's summat wrong som'ers, and I'll see if I cannot piekit out wi' this 'ere fork. There be two fellows along with Lon'op Mister, that I wouldn't mind accommodating wi'-a apiece. (Exit, 3n. L. u. f.)

SCENE III.-PARK, 2 GROOVE, WALL, AND GATES, L. 2 E. ENTER AUGUSTUS, DRUNK, L H. 2 E.

Aug. (Outside.) It's afloat-I'm afloat-(Enters, r. 2 e.) and toll-loll-loll-I'm afloat, for my head is swimming. I'm in a sea of delight; champagne is fizzing in my ears, and I hear a platoon of corks interminable. Let's see where I am. This is-am-there's a river, and those are trees-willow trees. Why, 'tis the Copse!
ACT I, SCENE I: 
My dear boy, you’re drunk, sir -- drunk as an owl -- drunk as five shillings. Hold up, or I ’ll give you in charge—damned if I don’t! Holloa, you willows -- move on there -- we’ll have no weeping there --not a word from ye------
(Enter Meg with a pitchfork, L. h. 3 E.)
What the devil’s that ?

Meg. What, the Lon’on Mister ? Then I’m off. (Crosses to R. u.)

Aug. Lend us the loan of your fishing-rod. ( He seizes the fork, and pulling it from her, he falls. Meg runs off r. Hulks and Staggers enter r 2 E. Augustus, having risen, embraces Hulks, thinking it Meg. Staggers down l.) Aug. I’ve got you, eh ! Why, it isn’t you -- it’s somebody else. (Sings.) I’m afloat -- I’m afloat.

Slag. Afloat! Looks as if he were adrift

Hulks. Now look here, my cove -- we’ve a little job for you to do.

Aug. It isn’t to job anybody’s eyes out with this ere fork, is it?

Hulks. No. Do you see that wall ?

Aug. Well, as I a’n’t wall-ey’d, I do.

Hulks. Now, we want you to get over that wall, and open the gate.

Aug. To be sure I will.

Hulks. Then come along. (Goes to L. Augustus tries to slip off r., but is brought back by Staggers.)

Stag. Noss look here, old fellow -- I ’ll make a back and you mount.

Aug. Well, ymi a*n*tthe first jackass as I have mounted hi my time. (Hulks and Staggers assist Augustus in getting upon the wall. He falls off once or twice.)

Aug. O’O’O!

Stag. What’s the matter?

Aug. There’s broken glass on the wall.

Stag. Not a word from you! Does it hurt much ! (Augustus gets over -- dog barks -- door opens and Augustus comes out hurriedly.)

Aug. The dog -- the dog!

Stag. Never holloa. (Takes bread from his pocket -- whittles to the dog -- throws bread -- dog ceases to bark. Hulks and Staggem exeunt at door leading Augustus, who is alarmed.)

ACT I, SCENE IV:
5 grooves. The Manor House -- an old Elizabethan mansion, c., the projecting portico of which is practicable. The windows are lighted up -- gardens extend, u n., with shrubberies, etc. A small pavilion, summer house, R. of c.

Enter Hulks, Augustus and Staggem.

Hulks. All right -- have you quieted the dog!

Stag. (Entering with a lantern) Never holloa -- the animal is enjoying a cold collation.

Aug. I say, old fellow, how powerful the moon is I -- I am getting quite tamed.

Stag. Hush! The lights are moving. (The lighted windows show person moving within the house)

Hulks. They are going to bed -- now’s the time for work before the house is quiet; cause if any noise is heard, they’ll think ’tis one of themselves. (A light appears over the half door.)

Stag. They are coming out -- look!

Aug. Let’s be off.

Hulks.
(Holding him.) Hush.

A noise of bells, and the footing of a clock.

Hulks. They are frightening the door. See, the moon is dark again.

Stag. Nottingham must be it.

Hm. Just where is the diamond to start the glaze?

Stag. (Draws an instrument from his coat pocket.) Here you are.

Hulks. Here's the knife - slip out the pane easy, while I talk him over.

(Staggers takes the lantern to the window, and is seen working at it.)

Hulks. Now, then, for the five thousand!

Aug. But I say, stop; what's all this? Why, that's the Manor House.

Hulks. Right.

Aug. And - and - 'tis midnight.

Hulks. To a minute.

Aug. Why, this is a trespass!

Hulks. You are drunk.

Aug. Why, he is breaking into the house!

Hulks. Exactly.

Aug. Why, at that rate, he's a house-breaker!

Hulks. You're getting sober.

Aug. Come, I say, old fellow, no nonsense! You know a joke's a joke.

Hulks. (Seizing his wrist.) Listen! You see that window - beyond it is a hall. To the right there is a passage - a narrow staircase. Mount softly, count nine stairs, and turn to the left - that's the corridor; feel your way to the third door, open it gently, and that's the lumber-room.

Aug. Oh! that's the - ah!

Hulks. On a shelf, just behind the door, is a wooden case - -

Aug. Lord!

Hulks. A pistol-case. Take it gently, and return as you came.

Aug. Well!

Hulks. That's all.

Aug. Nothing more?

Stag. All's ready! (He opens the window and pushes down the shutters.)

Aug. But, I say, isn't this - a - a - what do you call it?

Hulks. I don't know; but this I do know - that case is in my hands in ten minutes, or you are in those of the police.

Stag. What! What! What! Does our dear boy flunk? Has the kid moral compunctions?

Hulks. Hush! I heard a footstep this way.

Aug. So did I - let's cut.

Hulks. 'Twas nothing. Come, quick, my boy - in with you!

Aug. But -

Stag. Not a word from you.

Aug. If I meet anybody -

Hulks. That's true. Here. (Draws a pistol.) If you can run for it, do; if not - (places the pistol in his hands.)

Aug. Oh, Lord! What - eh?

Stag. Make no noise! (Placing the knife in his other hand.)

Aug. What, you mean, instead of shooting (Makes a motion with the knife.) Oh! to think I should ever - I shall faint on the mat!

Hulks. Hold up.
STAG: Not a word from ye—who's afraid?
AUG: Yau are. You ought to be ashamed of yourself—a big fellow like you!
HULKS: Take off your shoes. (Munc.)
AUG: 0, Lord! O, Lord! (Takes off his shoes and his coat. They lift him up, one on each tide, and put him in at the window.)
HULKS: (Looks after him.) Hush! Curse him, he tramps *ike a London policeman! Ha! ha! he has found the stairs—he is up—all right. Will the fool miss the corridor? I can hear no more. Stay, I hear whispering! It's all up, BID—he's caught!—no, a door shuts. Damn the fellow, he takes it easy! A footstep upon the stairs!—’t is he! Here he comes! (Augustus creeps through the window with a box under hit arm.)
AUG: 0, Lord!
HULKS: Who spoke to ye?
AUG: I met somebody!
STAG: And you—mode no noise?
AUG: I discovered—
HULKS: What?
AUG: The butler was married to the cook; or, if he a'n't he ought to be.
STAG: What, you met him in the dark, and he mistook you for the cook?
AUG: No; she mistook me for the butler, and—0, Lord, here's the box!
HULKS: Quick! (He opens the box, kneeling before it, and Stagobbs holds the lantern. He empties out papers, reading.) “Received 1840 to 1846—Accounts of Willow Farm—no—no. What's this?—this?—copy of lease and release. Curse it, have I been duped! What's this? (Reads.) “My last will and testament.” Huzza, here it is! Stay—light—Bill—in it? (Reads.) “William Richard Vaughan, give and bequeath to Luke Fielding the sum of one shilling.” Um—urn!—ha! ha! “And the sole residuary legatee, Rose Fielding,”—right—right—right—and—(Goes on reading hastily.)
Enter SIR RICHARD and LUCY, l. h.
SIR R.: This way, Lucy; the hall door is closed, but the garden window of my study—(Sees Hulks.) Ha! What's here?
LUCY: Heavens! Sir Richard! Those men!
SIR R.: Hush! The house has been robbed! Conceal yourself—there may be danger. Hush! This pavilion—quick!—the ruffians may escape!
LUCY: Let them—but do not expose your life. (She enters the pavilion, B. S x. He closes the door and comes forward.)
HULKS: All right signed and sealed—he's mine!
SIR R.: Not yet, villains!
HULKS: (Rises.) Down with him. Bill! (Music.) (Sir Richard swings round, and he falls.)
STAG: Help! Bick!
HULKS: Fire, fool! You have the pistol—damn ye, fire!
AUG: Fire what? Fire, eh! 0! Who, when! 0! Where! (Fires the pistol into the air.)
HULKS: Fool! Give me the knife. (Snatches it from him—lights begin to move rapidly within the house—lights a little up.)
Now, let's get started with the normalization process:

(As he raises the knife he recognizes Sib Richard)

Sir R: You—you, here!

Hulks: You know me. Yes, I am here—robbery has been committed—suspicious people might say we did it. Look ye, we must escape—escape, or you know what.

Sir R: Begone, wretches! Quit my sight! Away!

(Noises and lights in the hall. They exit, L.; Sir R: They are coming; where can I conceal myself! Ha!—the pavilion!

(Runs up to the pavilion and enters it as the hall door opens.

Enter servants with lights. Lord Bubblemere in a dressing-gown, with a fowling-piece. Fungus, Arthur, Lady Apsley, Miss Apsley, Georgina. The windows open, and servants appear.)

Arthur: What means this alarm? A robbery!—See this box—these papers!

Bub: Where’s the baronet!

Fung: He is not in his room.

Georg: Nor is Miss Vanguard in her chamber.

Lady A: How! Sir Richard and Miss Vanguard absent at this hour? Arthur! Arthur!

Arthur: Your suspicions are degrading and unworthy of you. (To servants.) Go round the grounds, alarm the tenantry.

Enter Meg, SE. L. H.

Meg: Stop, stay! I was hiding and saw it all. I couldn't see their faces, but I can tell 'ee where one o' the chaps is gotten—he's in your summer house.

Arthur: The pavilion! Surround it!

(The servants encircle the pavilion.)

Arthur: 'Tis locked—force it open!

Meg: Here, let's have a bang at it! Clear away there.

(The door of the pavilion opens. Sir Richard appears and closes the door behind him.)

All: Sir Richard!

Lady A: Sir Richard, are you aware —

Sir R: Of the robbery! Yes, I was here—But the ruffians were armed, and numerous.

Lady A: Miss Vanguard is nowhere to be found!

Sir R: Not to be found! She is surely in the house. Where should she be! I entreat your ladyship to retire; we will investigate this burglary tomorrow. (All go up a.)

(Meg has gone behind to Sir Richard.)

Meg: There's someone still in here; come out, whoever you are.

(Music. Throws open the door and discovers Lucy.)

Arthur: Lucy!

Lady A: Miss Vanguard!

Sir R: Destruction!

Curtain.

ACT III.

Music.

Scene L—The Lodge of the Manor House and grounds. Enter Vanguard and Luke, L. H., as if from a journey.

Vanguard: Come, Luke, you shall not go down to your farm until you have seen Arthur; he must thank you.

Luke: Nay, Colonel, I would fain step home; the tenantry are already feasting at the Hall; I must tuck Rose under my arm and join them.

Vang: You shan’t stir, I tell you; and see, look, here they come!
ARTHUB: Victory, my boy, victory!—your return is certain. I wanted to remain, but Luke would return to join in the festivities to-night.

LADY APSLEY: I fear, Colonel, we shall be unable to be of the party.

BUBBLEMERE: Quite impossible.

COLONEL: Indeed! Why! What! (Looks from Arthur to Lady Apsley.) What’s the matter?

LADY A: Circumstances compel us to withdraw ourselves immediately from Sir Richard’s roof.

COL: A quarrel! Come, come, your ladyship is hasty! What is it, eh?

ARTHUR: My dear Colonel, Deed I assure you of my esteem—of my—my affection? Prepare yourself for a most unhappy event.

COL: An unhappy event!—what—what?

ARTHUR: Do not press an explanation. Sir Richard will, doubtless—that is—my hopes have been most cruelly—believe me, it is only on the most painful conviction—that I have yielded.

COL: I suppose your ladyship is conducting your son to a lunatic asylum.

LADY A: On the contrary—thank Heaven!—he has just recovered his senses.

COL: Then, may I venture to ask, with all the calmness possible, what the devil the jackanapes means?

LADY A: Colonel, Colonel, your excitement is natural, the affair is delicate.

COL: Swamp your delicacy! Out with it, if you please, ma’am!

LADY A: Mr. Fielding, one word. (To Cot) You permit it?

COL: O, certainly! (Aside) What are they all at?

LADY A: (Atide to Luke.) In one word, Mr. Fielding, Mbs Vanguard was discovered last night, under the most compromising circumstances, with Sir Richard Vaughan.

LUKE: Lucy! And your son! She lets him go without a word?

LADY A: She does. I pray convey this matter delicately to the Colonel; believe me—I pity him—from my heart. Good-morning! (Exit, l. 2 x.)

BUBB: Good-morning, Colonel. (Exit, l. 2 x.)

COL: Come, Luke, now we shall come at the truth at least.

LUKE: Why, ye see—I—give me your hand; Ralph; we have been old friends—and—and—

COL: What’s that to do with it? Why, damme, you are as bad as the rest!—you are all in a league to draw me into the gout again!

LUKE: Look ye, will you take my advice?

COL: What bit?

LUKE: Go back to Lynn, take the rail up to London, and just wait until ye hear from me.

COL: Why, what the devil are you talking about? Are ye mad too?

MAO (entering): Eh! master, is that you come back? There be such a riot up at the Manor House.

COL: A riot, Meg?

MAO: Ees, all the grand folks is a goin’.

COL: I know it.
NA WIUBOW CM*

[Enter Meg.]

Meg. Lees, all along of Sir Richard cutting out the Parliament man.

[Luke sighs to her.]

Col. What?

Meg. Ees. [Aside.] What's master shakin' his head like the parson for? [Aloud.] Ees, Parliament mister don't like as how Miss Lucy should keep company with the squire.

Col. Keep company with Sir Richard?

Luke. [Aside.] How shall I stop her?

Col. [Forcing a laugh.] Ha ha! And so... and so...

Meg. Em, he... he... and so, because Sir Richard and Miss Lucy took a walk last night... nat'ral enough... lev'ying, we know...

Luke. Meg!

Col. Luke, Luke, hold off! Hush! Yes, natural enough.

Meg. Ees, natural enough... ess... so, they was found in the summer house after all t'other folks had gone to bed.

Colt. [Sewing Meg.] Look you! Look you well what you say!

Meg. O! My! O! Mister Colonel! Don't 'ee, don't 'ee!

Col. My daughter? Go on, out with it all!

Meg. I come on them suddenly, in the Willow Copse, last night.

Col. My daughter?

Meg. Ees, and Sir Richard. Miss Lucy was a-crying, and says she, "Richard, if we go back again together, Lady Apsley will suspect summat."

Col. Ha!

Meg. But the squire talked her over, and they come home together.

Col. At midnight?

Meg. Em, and then came the robbery which alarmed the house; all the folks run out, and, in searching for the villains, they found Miss Lucy and Sir Richard locked up in the summer house. And that be all. [Exit, l. h.]

Col. Luke, Luke, is it so? Your silence owns it.

Meg. Why, ye all seem to look the same; why, what's amiss... what?

Luke. Begone! Go! [Crosses to Meg.] Your foolish tongue has done enough of mischief.

Meg. Mine... why, I've only said the truth. 

[Exit Meg, u. h.]

Col. Where... where is she?

Luke. Be calm, for my sake.

Col. Calm... 'tis well for you to preach forbearance! The villain whom I have loved and trusted as a son! Thank Heaven, he is not a coward as well as a villain! [Crosses, l. h.]

Luke. Ralph, what would you do... the son of an old friend?

Col. Friend! I have no friend; even you desert me and defend him.

Luke. Remember that on his life depends Lucy's honor.

Col. I do not beg reparation, I demand revenge!

[Blank letter for Rose.]

[Enter Rose, b. h. 2 l.]

Rose. Father!

[Luke embraces her.]

Col. Ay, protect, watch over her... she is innocent! But Lucy... Lucy... whom I have so loved, so trusted! But I cannot believe it. She was too good, too pure, to play so vile a part. You are right, Luke... here is some mystery, and I will penetrate it.

[Exit, 2 e. l. a.]

Luke. Has Lucy confided in you?
ROSE: Nothing, father, but that she has quarreled with Arthur.

LUKE: You know the cause?

ROSE: No!

LUKE: Their meeting last night in the Willow Copse.

ROSE: Ah! who—who —

LUKE: Lucy and Sir Richard.

ROSE: The Willow Copse, last night?

LUKE: My poor Rose, I understand your feelings; yes, I have seen with pride, for some time, that Richard seemed to love you; and you, too, looked kindly on him; and if I have dreamed sometimes of such a thing, I was, perhaps, a foolish old man; but I loved ye both.

ROSE: But this meeting?

LUKE: They returned, it seems, to the Manor House together, and were discovered in some retreat. Yet how can I believe that Lucy could —

ROSE: She did not—she is innocent!

LUKE: I'd lay my life on it;—but how you tremble, Rose, and you are as pale as death, my poor child, Rose!

ARTHUR enters.

ARTHUR: Rose!

ROSE: Tell me—Lucy—she is charged with guilt, because last night she was seen in the Willow Copse.

ARTHUR: You are agitated, Rose.

ROSE: Speak!

ARTHUR: Yes—and her refusal, in spite of my entreaties, to account for such a step—

ROSE: Has caused her to be condemned!

ARTHUR: Oh, could I believe her innocent!

ROSE: But, what—what if she went on an errand of mercy—to save from—from death a guilty creature—driven to despair and madness? What if, while pouring comfort and courage into a broken heart, Sir Richard came accidentally—

ARTHUR: Rose, Rose!—you would save your friend by a fabrication.

ROSE: 'T is true—on my soul, 't is true!

ARTHUR: Neither her father nor Lady Apsley would believe it, and she, will she, confess as much?

ROSE: She must—she shall. She shall not suffer for my crime!

ARTHUR: Your crime?
ACT III, SCENE II.

Rose: Yes, my crime!—mine.I—I alone am the guilty one! In the depth of my despair I wrote to my father, confessing it, and declaring my determination to rid myself of my hated life! Unable to read, he begged Lucy to assist him.

Arth: Ah! I understand it now; but why, why is Sir Richard silent?

Hose: Alas! he is the cause of my misery!

Arth: Rose, you are restoring me to life! What proof can you give me that this is so?

Rose: Here, here is the letter which caused it all. Take it, show it to your mother, to the Colonel; publish my shame—but she—Lucy, dear Lucy—I have saved her!

Arth: Rose, this letter is sacred from all eyes but my mother’s and the Colonel’s. Believe me, you shall not suffer.

Rose: O, sir! if I ask it—if I pray you to spare me—it is not for myself, but my father—my poor father! For his sake, I have consented to a life of deceit and hypocrisy, until I could no longer bear my anguish! For his sake, I live on, in the faint hope that Richard may restore me at last!

Arth: He must—he shall! Come, Rose, let us seek Lucy together—noble, noble girl! Ah! with such a friend, you need never despair; and I, too, am I not grateful? Come.

(Exit, B. h. Music)

SCENE III.—The avenue of oaks. The lawn tables spread for a harvest feast. Gate, c. Railing. The tenants and laborers are seated round. The servants are assisting. In the b. H. is a large hogshead, tapped, astride of which Joseph sits, and acts as toastmaster. Music.

Joseph: No, I won’t pull out the spigot once more till Master Luke arrives. I’m lord of the harvest, and, if anybody says who are you, I’ll knock him into the middle of next county. Huzza. (Omnes.)

Enter Hulks, dressed in the height of fashion, followed by Staggers, L. 2 E.

Stag: I say, Dick, my dear boy, I’m getting very nervous—and that being the case, I shall clap my mare between my blessed legs, and leave this blessed county.

Hulks: Well, as you please—but where can Rom be?

Enter Augustus extravagantly dressed, l 2 t

Joe: Here be some friends of the squire. A cheer, lads, for the squire’s company.

All: Huzza! (Dipping over the end of the cask and drawing himself a mug of ale.)

Joe: Here’s the health of the squire’s company.

All: Huzza! (All drink.)

Aug: You are very good; would you have any objection to perform that agreeable pantomime again, you youthful Bacchus?

Joe: K mug o’ ale—

Aug: Or a draught on Barclay and Co.

(Joe draws a mug of ale.)

Joe: (To Staggers.) I say, my large friend, will you have a drop of this?—step this way.

Stag: Make no noise. (Exit, b. h.)

(Augustus and Joseph exit)

Hulks: She comes.

Enter Rose, u. r r h. 

End of Act III, Scene II.
Good morning, Miss Fielding!

Rose. {Aside.) That man again!

Hulks. I told you we should meet again; and now let me confess that a romantic folly caused me to assume a-- a-- modest attire --in which I hoped to win a flattering proof of disinterested affection.

Rose. Sir, I care not who or what you may be, but you must see that your persistence is unwelcome.

Hulks. I am a gentleman of rank, of fortune; my views are honorable.

Rose. If you are a gentleman, you will desist from a pursuit which can only mortify you, and distress me.

Hulks. Rose, I know this secret of your love.

Rose. Ah!

Hulks. Hush! 'Twas I who saved you from ruin; 'twas I who divined the intentions of Sir Richard, and compelled him to abandon his plans.

Base. You?

Hulke. I am he, who has but to hum his hand & fell him to the earth.

Rose. Ah! I know you.

Hulke. You know, then, that on your compliance not only depends your own fortune, but the fate of him. If you hate him, I offer you revenge; if you love him, I offer you his gratitude.

Enter Sir Richard, L. 2 E.

Rose. And you, you would accept this so--

Hulke. I would.

Rose. And he--

Hulke. Let him speak for himself.

Sir R. (Aside.) Ah! he here? (Crosses L.)

Rose. Richard, I know your secret! This man, is he your dread?

Sir R. Betrayed!

Rose. No. I know no more than that--

Hulkt. Sir Richard knows me, and answers for the honesty of my intentions.

Enter a Servant, L. 2 E.

Sir R. (Aside.) Villain!

Serv. The parish constable, Sir Richard, and a Bow-street officer, have a warrant, which they beg you will sign.

(Exit, L. 2 E.)

Hulke. Sir Richard regrets that he cannot wed you himself, and so commends you to one who can, and trusts--

Rose. Richard!

Sir R. Fiend!

Enter Omcoot & 2 B.

Officer. Pardon, Sir Richard--I shall not detain you a moment. Your signature to these warrants.

Sir R. Sir, I am engaged.

Officer. I would not trouble you, sir, but we have information that the criminal in question is in your parish, or has been lately, and we don't doubt is connected with the robbery committed here.

Hutke. (To Sir R.) Speak! Confirm my words!

Sir R. This is no time.

Hulk*. The best. Look you, there stand the wardens of the law; these your tenantry. It is the best time, I say. Will you speak, or shall I?

Sir R. Rom!

(Exit, L. 2 E.)

Rose. Do not hush! Do not speak. (To Hulks.) I beg you, sir, to leave us for a while.
Hulko: Madam, I am your most obedient
(Goes up and qf a)

Sir R. (Officer): I will attend you in my library.
(Exit Officer, l. 2.a.)

Rose: Richard, I have confessed all to Arthur -- the letter I wrote to my father, to beg his forgiveness for the fatal purpose from which Lucy saved me!

Sir R.: That letter --
Rose: Is now in Lady Apsley's hands.
Sir R.: We can depend upon her discretion, if we can but appease this demon.
Rose: Your crime, then, is very -- very deep.
Sir R.: Rose!
Rose: You cannot, then, atone it!
Sir R.: Yes. I can leave this place forever, and seek a refuge in some distant quarter of the globe, where another name will cover my shame.
Rose: And mine, Richard?
Sir R.: Hush!
Eider Col.: Yaxguabd and Lujo?, l. h.

Col.: Ah, sir! At last I have found you. My daughter --
Luke: Ralph, you promised me to be temperate. Sir Richard, we do not and cannot believe the reports which saluted us on our arrival here.
Sir R.: You do me justice, Luke; and, if you will leave me with the Colonel, I will explain.
Col.: No, sir! No mysteries. The calumny has been public; the reparation must be the same.
Enter Axtbbb and Loot, b.h.2l
JLrth.: It shall be so. (To Col. Vanguard.) Accept my sincerest apologies for all I have thought and said. Miss Vanguard forgives me.
(Luke crosses to Abjtbuo.)
Luke: Hey, lad, give me your hand! I knew it -- here's some deviltry at the bottom of this. (Crosses to b. h.)
Col.: Mr. Apsley -- Arthur -- but this is no satisfaction to me -- none. I am played upon. This netting -- 
(Lucy talks to Rosfc, tote weeps.)

[End of Act I]
Col.: It is nothing, Luke, nothing!

Luke: Nothing! Why, Colonel, you said the shame was public, and -- and -- at least to me, you will!

Col.: No, Luke, no.

Luke: And you are satisfied -- that letter has proved her innocence.

Col.: Why, Luke, do you doubt it; and, as I am satisfied, it is enough.

Luke: No! (Snatches the letter from him.) -- 't is not enough for me!

Col.: Give me that letter! Give it, I say!

Luke: Stand back, 't is mine! Mine! (To Lucy) -- you have deceived me in reading it. (To the Col.) And you, too -- you -- but since I have faith in none of ye, you Rose, you shall read it. (He takes her by the wrist and draws her forward. Pause.)

Rose: (Reading through her tears.) "My father, I have dishonored your name. Forgive your poor, broken-hearted, guilty child, if your love, unworthy of it as she is, is too great a reproach to endure; and, if she prefers death to daily hypocrisy"-

Luke: But you live -- you live -- go on!

Rose: (Still weeping.) "Forgive me if I do not name the author of my shame; let your curse fall on me alone; on me alone your vengeance. Farewell, my father! My last prayer will be for you; the tears that now fell on this paper are for you, not for myself. May heaven, to which I go, in its mercy, remember only my anguish, and forget my crime. Farewell!" (Pause.)

Luke: (Slowly looks upwards.) O! you, my children, and you -- loved and gentle sharer of my labors, and my hopes, look down from heaven, and bear up my withering heart; inspire me with the force to live until this murder of my honor shall be expiated and avenged!

Lady A.: Now, Miss Vanguard, accept my sincerest congratulations.

Col.: Hush! Another time, for Heaven's sake!

Luke: Speak, madam, 0, speak on! -- to every man his right; to virtue and innocence, respect; to vice and crime, shame and degradation. Come, Rose -- come -- our place is no longer amongst the honest and the happy!

(Ready to sink down.)

(He takes her hand, and, letting his head sink on her breast, he goes up, leading Rose, the crowd leave a passage for him and incline before his sorrow.)

Curtain.

ACT IV.

Scene L -- Interior of Willow Farm (as seen in Act III).
Luke discovered seated, l. h. Rose is sitting at a table, n. h. Crowd of laborers and farm girls are behind the table and at the back, l. h.
Rose: (Writing.) Joseph!

Joe: (Advancing.) Yea, Miss Rose.

Rose: Twenty-three shillings—Is not that right?

Joe: Oh, yes, Miss, of course it be! But, that— (Looks to the other laborers, who murmur) -me, and my fellows here, we make bold to ask, Miss, why we are called on a Tuesday to be paid, Miss?

Rose: My father intends to give up the farm, and to leave this place.

All: No—no—no! (Joe consults with them apart.)

Rose: Pray, take the money, Joseph!

Joe: (Advancing — twirling his hat awkwardly.) Miss Rose, my fellow and me, want me to say, as how, seeing you — Master Luke has been a good and kind master. We don’t forget what he did for us in the hard times — we don’t —

All: No! no!

Joe: No, we don’t! And—if so be as times is changed, and things go bad with him—why, we say, Miss—we can’t pay back the bread he gave our little ones—but we can work, Miss—and we can starve, Miss.

All: Ay—ay!

Joe: But, but, we can’t let Master Luke from amongst us—we can’t nohow!

All: No—no!

Joe: And we won’t take a farthing of his money; so that’s what we and my fellows want to say, Miss; and God bless you!

All: God bless you, Master Luke! (They move to go up.)

Rose: Oh, this is too bitter! (Falls forward, weeping.)

Luke: Stay, Joseph, and you, stay—take the price of your toil. I can pay it. Heaven has judged it well to afflict me; its will be done. But—but—bless you all! And if you would repay my kindness—forget it; lest, with it, you remember my dishonor. (Sinks back into his former position.)

All: (Murmur) No—no!

Rose: No more, Joseph, pray, I entreat! There—(She pushes the money towards him—he takes it silently.)

Joe: We heard as how Meg had made mischief at the Manor House. If so be, she is to blame for this—(All murmur threateningly) the county won’t hold her long—no, no!

Rose: Janet, here are the wages of the girls—count it.

Janet: (Weeping.) Oh, Miss!

Rose: Take it, and divide it, and now leave us! (They exit slowly, d. r. Rose remains at the table. Pause. Luke rises and advances to the table.)

Luke: And now, to render my account! (Rose rises.) Sit—be—seated—you are mistress here.

Rose: What do you mean?

Luke: I come to pay a debt. (He takes from his breast an old pocket-book, and places it before her.) Sit, I pray! (She falls back in a chair.) I come to render you an account of this farm, which is yours.

Rose: Father!

Luke: Thank Heaven, no man can say Luke Fielding owes him a tester, or holds a farthing that should be another’s. I will not begin by being the debtor of my own children!

Rose: Father!

Luke: I ask you for a moment’s patience! I was a laborer on this farm. I had nothing in the world but my courage, my strength, and my honesty. Your mother’s father thought these were worth a few pounds, for he gave me his only child!
Rose: My mother! (Weeps.)
Luke: With her I received this farm; but we were not rich then. And when she bore me four sons, and life was dear to keep—it wanted thrift and labor; but Heaven blessed us, and we prospered. Then came our share of sorrow. Sickness visited my little ones; and, in two years, I followed my four sons, my boys, my poor boys, to the churchyard. The blow was hard, for your mother died of it.
Rose: O! had I but shared their fate!
Luke: I remember when I stood beside her grave; you were an infant—my last, my only one. It rained hard, and was cold, and I had wrapped you in my bosom—you looked into my fane, and, as my tears fell fast upon you, you kissed my eyes, as F *• comfort me.
[Page header removed]
Rose: My father!
Luke: Death, like life, costs money; grief is idle too, and I found my store diminished; then, being my only one, J brought you up and educated you like a lady. I don’t know what I paid, but it was money still.
Rose: Father! have mercy on me—curse me, but spare me this! (Rises.)
Luke: So, you may think, that in thirty years I should have more laid up; but, although I cannot count, I know my reckoning true here. Here is the lease of the form,—’tis yours; and, in that pocket-book, there should be twelve hundred pounds.
Rose: Father—pity—pity—
Luke: Count them—count them!
[Page footer removed]
Rose: Hear me!
Luke: When I have cleared my score—count.
(Taku stage, l.)
(Rose opens the pocket-book, and counts the notes. Weeping.)
Luke: Is it there?
Rose: (Weeping.) I do not know. I cannot—yes—yes—
(Pause.)
Luke: The sacred trust confided to me is redeemed. Now give me an account of that you owe me. (Site.)
Rose: (Rising.) Father! Heaven does not deny mercy to the blackest criminal—and the very murderer, on his passage to the grave, listens to the priest who preaches mercy; but, for me, there is none. Speak, I have sinned, whpt is to be my expiation?
Luke: I am not Heaven, to condemn or to absolve. I am a creditor who asks you to repay. You hold my name—what have you done with it?
Rose: (Weeping.) I have dishonored it. I have disgraced you.
Luke: Disgraced me! No—for your crime? ’tis yours—yours—and you alone can answer it; but when that crime is handed down from lip to lip, it must not be coupled with my name!
Rose: What would you have me do?
Luke: Let him who shared your guilt, share also your shame!
Rose: He! he cannot!
Luke (Ritu.): He shall! (Taku stage, x) If I have to drag blip to the altar!
Rose: Father, you would endanger your life for me?
[Page header removed]
LUKE: Girl! I tell you, there are injuries from man to man. So deep, that we don't fight -- we kill! -- His name?

ROSE: Take my life!

LUKE: You want it for repentance -- his name?

ROSE: Yield him to your vengeance? -- never!

LUKE: His name, I say -- it is my due -- you owe it me!

ROSE: What would you do?

LUKE: Do I ask you what you will do with what is yours? No -- I pay! Now I demand as much from you -- you!

ROSE: (Falling at his feet.) Kill me, kill me! I cannot name him! (A knock is heard, D. T. A pause.)

ROSE: Ah! (The knock is repeated.)

LUKE: Who can that be at this hour?

SIR R.: Hist! Rose -- Rose --

LUKE: A voice repeats your name!

ROSE: My -- my --

LUKE: You tremble! (She attempts to speak, he places his hand on her mouth.) Hush! (He drags her to the door, b. a, at which is a hatchet, which he takes.)

ROSE: (Whispering.) Oh! what -- what would you do?

LUKE: I would bid him welcome!

SIR R.: (Half opening the door. Whispers.) Dearest Rose!

LUKE: Bid him enter! {Music.)

ROSE: (Hoarsely.) Fly! fly! (Falls fainting as Sir Richard enters. He is wrapped in a cloak. Luke seizes Sir R. and drags him forward. A struggle ensues, in which Sir Richard's hat falls off, while, by loosening his cloak, he escapes from Luke, but falls against the chair.)

LUKE: Richard -- Rich -- you -- (The uplifted hatchet falls from his hand -- he staggers towards Sir R. Luke makes an ineffectual attempt to speak. Sir R. retreats before the haggard gate of Luke, who seizes the corner of the table for support. He seems convulsed, and rolls backwards into the chair, his body being half across the table, with the face upwards.)

SIR R.: Betrayed! (Runs to Rose.) Rose -- dear Rose! Ah, has feinted, fatal chance. I had prepared all for our fight; my own carriage is now on the high road, beyond the Copse. The moment is come, and even thus it is better she should leave her home. By the garden I can reach the highway unobserved. {Music. He raises her inanimate body and bears her out, l. n. d. Yelling outside. The door opens, and Meg runs in, followed by Joseph and the crowd of laborers, who vociferate yells and cries of disgust.)

MEG: What have I done, that ye all yell at me? Stand off!

JOSEPH: If ye want a Woman; I'd take it out of ye. I would-----

MEG: Stand off, or ye'll rue it, him that touches me! Man or woman, I fear ye not! There's not one among ye, that I couldn't wring his neck like a chicken -- and ye know it. Meg can take her own part.

MEG: What has I done?

JOSEPH: Done! You've druv our master from the farm, and ruined Miss Rose!

MEG: Master, you hear what they say?
Luke: (vacantly)  
Meg: But it is not true—say so, toaster. You will not quit this farm?  
Luke: Ay!  
Meg: And leave us—me and Miss Rose?  
Luke: (dreamily) Rose—Rose! my darling Rose!  
(sits down and leans his face on his hands, weeping bitterly. Meg looks around in wonder)  
Meg: (to Luke) Master! Master! Dear Master Luke! I don't ask you to forgive me; but beat me, do—tread on me! I've ruined you! I know it now. Speak! Say something hard to me!  
Luke: Meg! Poor Meg! What's this? You're crying—  
Meg: Master, don't speak kind to me—I can't bear it! I—why, how pale you are, and odd! (clasps his hand)  
Joe: (who has been gazing at Luke) Poor master! Why don't you see— (retreating, with his eye fixed on Luke)  
Meg: See what?  
Joe: He's mad!  
Meg: (starts up aghast) M—mad!  
Luke: Rose! Rose!  
(Luke utters an inarticulate sound. Meg gazes on him with agony, Joseph with fear.)  
(Curtain - Slow drop.)  

ACT V.  
(A period of four years is supposed to elapse between the fourth and fifth Acts.)  

Music.  

Scene L—A room in the house of Sir Richard Vanguard, in London. Rose, elegantly dressed, is discovered seated in a chair—she is asleep—a book, which she has been reading, is in her hand—a shaded lamp burns dimly on a table beside her. Fireplace, R. 2 E. Window, L. 3. A pause—after which a French clock is heard to strike four.  

Rose: (starting from her sleep) Ah! What noise was that? Surely I was not asleep. (Goes to clock) Four—four o'clock, and Richard not returned! Perhaps he has left word with the servant. (Rings)  
Enter George, C.  
Rose: George, did Sir Richard mention at what hour he would return?  
George: No, my lady.  
Rose: You may retire. (sits down) Stop, Sir Richard has a pass-key—he was late, late last night.  
George: Yes, my lady—four o'clock.  
Rose: Very good. (Exit George) Five o'clock—night after night, it is the same—yet I cannot reproach him with unkindness or neglect. For six years—six long years, he has been a slave to my slightest wish; he has never been absent from my side. (Noise of carriage) Ah! 'tis he, at last. Let him not see that I have been sad.  
Enter Sir Richard, C.  
Sir R.: Rose, this is unkind of you. Did you not promise me to retire to rest?  
Rose: Forgive me, Richard, I could not. I am restless—I cannot sleep. Where have you been?
SIR R. 0, to the club. I've just come from thence.
Enter George, c.
GEORGE. The cabman says, sir, his fare from Mile End is four-and-sixpence.
SIR R. (Sharply.) Pay it, sir, and begone!
(Exit George, c.)
ROSE. Mile End! Why, Richard, I thought your club was in Pall-MalL
SIR R. So it is, my love; but the cabman, you see, mistook the way—he took me a round.
ROSE. (Aside.) He is deceiving me. (Pause.) (Aloud.) Richard, do not think I wish to invade your secrets, or to reproach you with your absence. You have loved me dearly—I know it, and I am grateful; but----
SIR R. Rose, dearest, hear me, and you will forgive me an innocent deception. You know the only cloud that has obscured our happiness—our only subject of sorrow.
ROSE. My father—
SIR R. When I inquired at the form, I found that on the night of your departure, he had disappeared.
ROSE. You told me so.
SIR R. Meg, also, has gone—no one could tell where—no trace of either of them could be found.
ROSE. Dear Richard, always thoughtful of my happiness! Must I and mine be always a source of sorrow to you?
SIR R. Do you imagine I have not detected the signs of that grief in which you indulge when I am absent—the traces of tears hastily brushed away on my entrance, that they might not seem to reproach me? Why dissemble with me?
GEORGE. (Re-entering.) The cabman will not leave the door; he insists on seeing you.
SIR R. On seeing me! What can he mean? Is he dissatisfied? Pay him what he asks, and send him away.
GEORGE. He is quite satisfied, sir, but insists very respectfully on speaking with you.
SIR R. I will go down—no, bid him come here.
ROSE. Let him come in.
GEORGE. (Going to c. D.) Sir Richard will see you.
Enter Lynx, dressed in a heavy and ragged coat, c.
LYNX. I beg pardon, sir; but I'd make bold to ask, sir, for a minute's talk with your honor.
SIR R. Well, sir!
LYNX. Alone!
SIR R. 0! (To the Servant.) Leave the room.
(Exit George.)
(Lynx looks about suspiciously. Loosens his great coat, and discovers a plain, but respectable blue suit underneath. Changing his rough voice to a respectable and quiet tone.)
LYNX. I trust, Sir Richard Vaughan, you will pardon my intrusion on yourself and Lady Vaughan, at such an hour.
SIR R. Your apparent disguise, sir—you are not the driver of the cab?
LYNX. No, sir; I am an officer of the detective police.
SIR R. Ha!
LYNX. There is a band of ruffians, who have eluded us for some time with singular ingenuity. We have reason to believe that the gang are under the direction of a person who was originally a lawyer's clerk; but, after a series of robberies, in all of which his knowledge of the law has enabled him to rescue himself and his associates, he is now disguised as a missionary preacher in search of subscriptions for a benevolent purpose.
Sir R.: But I do not see in what this concerns me.

Lynx: You have been for some days dogged by the pointers of this band.

Sir R.: I--!

[Google-digitized]

Lynx: And for four days I have never quitted you night and day, I have held your horse, driven eight or ten cabs in your service, and, in the low haunts into which you have penetrated, I have protected both your pocket and your person.

Sir R.: But indifferently -- for I lost both my watch and my purse.

Lynx: Yes, sir--there they are.

(Produces a watch and purse, which he returns to Sir Richard, who utters an exclamation of surprise.)

You have been in search of an old man, and you made an appointment at this time, with a person calling himself the Rev. Obadiah Sleeky.

Sir R.: Sir, you are well informed.

Lynx: I hope to be better, sir; for, if my suspicions be correct, this man is none other than the notorious Dick Hulks, who escaped last year from the convict-ship, at Chatham.

Sir R.: Hulks?

[Rote aside.] Can it be the same--

Sir R. [aside.] Hush!

Lynx: This man's emissary told you that a clue knight be obtained of the person you sought, and gave you an address. I would beg of you, sir, to keep that appointment.

Sir R.: I will go -- here is the address. (Produces card.)

Lynx: I know it, sir, for one of the vilest dens that infect the city.

[Rote.] Richard, you may be exposed to danger!

Lynx: Your ladyship need fear nothing. Your pardon, sir. (Goes to the window, which he opens and whistles. It is replied to without.) The kidds crib--Knacker's Lane, five o'clock.

(Voice without.)

Voice: Five o'clock.

(Lynx closes the window quietly, and replaces his great-coat.)

Lynx: Now, Sir Richard, I am ready to drive you to our destination.

(Sir Richard has opened a pistol-case, and taken out the weapons. Pistol-case, B.)

Lynx: You need not encumber yourself, sir. My precautions have been taken.

[Google-digitized]

Sir R.: Farewell, Rose.

Rose: For Heaven's sake, do not expose yourself! I will watch till you return.

Lynx: Fear not, your ladyship, for Sir Richard's safe return.

(Sir Richard sets out with Lynx, who salutes Rose with respect. Rose watches them out, and then runs to the window, as if to see them depart.)

Scene closes in.

Scene II -- A street in London, 1 n. A door, c., with knocker, etc. Enter Meg with two tin pails of milk. She goes to the house and rings.
MEG: These here London servants be as lazy as pigs. Ay, here's six o'clock, and not a soul stirring. (Rings.) A jolly milk-walk this is—half an hour at every bell— (Rings violently.)

(Enter AUGUSTUS, dressed very raggedly, a number of gaudy chains around his neck. He holds a knife with twenty blades bristling up in one hand, and two open razors in the other.)

AUG: (Mimicking.) Mee'aw—mee'aw—why can't yessy milk? (The door opens—MEG serves the milk.) I wonder if I covid wheedle her out of a ha'porth—perhaps she wants a knife or a row—a tight-looking, sort of a wench. (Meg takes up the pails and is going.)

AUG: Holloa, I say, come here—buy a knife? (Thrusts a knife into her face.)

MEG: (Recoiling.) Ah!

AUG: Have a razor, cheats. (As MEG seeks to avoid him, he follows her.) Five shillings the pair—say four.

MEG: Get out, will ye?

AUG: Holloa—stop—stay—hat voice! Why, it must be—Meg—your name is Meg?

MEG: Rees, my name's Meg.

AUG: Don't you remember me?—look—see.

MEG: I see—but I can't say that I ever set eyes on—stop. No, it be'nt.

AUG: Yes, it be—

MEG: What—what'—eh—noh—sh—hahe-ha-he! (Puts down her pails and laughs loudly.) Well, I— (Extra line break removed.)

AUG: Ah, Meg! you may laugh?—I wish I could. I believe there was a time I did laugh; I have for—forgot how I—

MEG: What's the matter?

AUG: (Dolefully.) Meg, I'm hungry.

MEG: Hungry?

AUG: Yes, it has been wet for two days. I have sold nothing—and so—I have eaten nothing.

MEG: Two days! Stop—stop—sit down—Sit. (Makes him sit on the pail—the tit on the other.) Here—here's my breakfast, poor Lon'on Mister! (Takes out some bread and breaks it.) There, there, eat it, coom. I don't laugh now, poor Lon'on Mister! Ye do look pale and thin—have some milk, do.

AUG: I will. (Lifts up lid of the pail he sits upon, and draws out some milk. They both eat—he drinks.)

MEG: But, tell me, what's come to ye?

AUG: I'll tell ye. You remember that dreadful day, four years ago, when I was taken by the police?

MEG: Remember it—ah!

AUG: Well, the result of that little affair was an invitation by the government to reflect on my conduct.

MEG: No!

AUG: Yes, and to give me time, they supported me two years, while I thought it over. That was the least wretched part of it; for, when I appeared in public, I found the world a closer prison than the penitentiary; for I was pinned within the four walls of want. I tried to escape; but hunger is a devilish wakeful jailer.
Meg: But you could work.

Aug: There was too little work for honest men, Meg. I had hopes -- wild hopes -- that I could get appointed to a cab-stand or waterman; but no -- But what are you doing? -- how came you to London?

Meg: O, sir! Do you remember my poor master?

Aug: Luke -- Luke -- something.

Meg: Luke Fielding -- he that lost his mind. Well, on this very night that you were took, he left the form. I could not stop him. I followed him for miles, begging him to return; still he went on -- on -- until I knew not where we were. Day came, and night again; and, wearied, he lay down to rest on the cold ground. I watched by him, until some laborers, going to work, passing by, I begged them to assist me. We removed him to the neighboring town, where, by the kindness of the magistrate, he was received in a place they call an 'asylum.'

Aug: An asylum -- poor devil!

Meg: Yes; for three years, I saw him every day, for I got work to do in the neighborhood; and, day by day, he got less wild; until, at last, they discharged him. He is not cured, but there is no harm in him now.

Aug: Good little angel! Meg, look ye, I'm changed from what you once knew me, except in one thing. I thought, four years ago, I was in love with you -- now, I'm sure of it.

Meg: La -- coom, I must be going!

Aug: Not yet! Your milk has got into my head, and gives me the courage of a lion. Meg, I will seek for work, I will beg for it, and I will find it; then, when I'm making twelve, perhaps fifteen shillings per week --

Meg: Fifteen shillings?

Aug: Yes, fifteen clear of income tax; shall we join our revenues, eh, Meg? We can support the old man, eh, between us. Say no more, only let me run and dispose of my stock in trade. Tell me, where shall I find ye?

Meg: Chalk farm dairy, from five in the morning till seven at night.

Aug: Good-by, Meg, farewell!

Meg: Good-by!

Aug: Stop! One kiss on account.

Meg: Ho! Woho! (Takes up the pail.) Stand off! Would ye spill the milk?

Aug: (Kisses her.) Go! Go! You are the milk-maid of human kindness.

Meg: Yes, and my customers is a waiting.

Aug: I'm off! (Runs off, n. n.)

Meg: Hee-haw! (Exit, l. l.)

(Change of Scene.)

Scene III -- Third Groove. Lights down. Dark stage. Interior of a night-house, or low public house in a cellar, steps leading down to it, l. h. Luke in a shabby dress is seated at the back, leaning his head on his arms, a quartern measure in pewter is before him. Two or three low, ragged creatures, men and women, are standing round a bar.
[Scene: A crowded room with people lying on benches and the floor.]

Enter Hulks and Staggers. Hulks pushes aside the crowd and is dressed in black with a white neckcloth.

Hulks: Come, clear away -- holloa! (Throws down half a crown.) Some brandy, and quick! Holloa, Krischin Fan! Fine news, Bill! Our bait has hooked the baronet. He has been in search of the old 'un, as we have been.

Stag: And we have dogged him, so as to take care he found nothing.

Hulks: Ay, but in the chase the old 'un has really turned up.

Stag: What! Luke?

Hulks: Luke -- ay, Luke Fielding. I have spoken with him.

Stag: Can he be made to understand what you want with him?

Hulks: We shall see. Fan!

Fan (advancing): Eh, Dick? -- eh, my son?

Hulks: Has the old 'un had the gin I ordered?

Fan: Every drop of it.

Hulks: Where is he?

Fan (going to Luke and shaking him): Holloa! Here's the gent back again -- come!

Luke (after rolling his head upon his arm): Eh, what is it? (Seizes the pewter measure and drains it.) No more -- more gin!

Hulks: Do you forget your own old farm, the Willow Farm?

Luke: The Willow Farm? No!

Hulks: You must remember your child.

Luke (with increasing agitation): My child?

Hulks: Rose.

Luke (uttering a suppressed yell): Rose! (He presses his hand to his head.) Down -- go down -- (looks up.) How can I remember her? She is dead -- but she has not left me alone. I see her sometimes -- yes -- but pale and white, and cold; and she sits down upon my bed and reads.

Hulks: Reads what?

Luke: A letter. I weep, but she will read. I implore her -- she reads -- reads -- reads!

Hulks: And what do you do?

Luke: I pray.

Hulks: Listen, and heed me! Rose lives -- lives with her betrayer. While you starve, they riot in your money -- in your estate. D'ye hear? But you would be revenged?

Luke: What's that?

Hulks: Richard Vaughan has destroyed your child -- ruined her.

Luke: Ruined -- destroyed! She is unhappy then?

Hulks: All his work!

Luke: Who is he? -- where is he? Give him to me that has hurt my child! Let me -- rend -- rend his heart out, and show her how black it is!

Hulks: You shall be revenged!

Luke: Where is he?

Hulks: Hush! We must be cautious, or he will hear us, and escape. First, you must sign this paper! (Draws out paper.) It enables me to crush him.

Enter Augustus down stairs.

Aug: Is there anybody will take my stock and shop? Here you are -- selling off -- a great sacrifice -- retiring from business!

(Hulks draws Luke towards the table.)

Stag: Never holloa, my dear boy, you're just in time for your dividend!

Aug: My dividend?

Stag: The old affair is turned up again. Bick is a wonder -- look. (Points to Luke and Hulks.) 

[End of scene.]
A'n'tit prime? 0! not a word from ye!

Hulks: Who's there? ha! the young 'un. Here lad -- come, put your name to this, as witness, while the old *un makes his cross.

Aug: What is it?

Hulks: What's that to you, if you get your share? isn't that enough? -- here. (Guides Luke's hand, who makes a cross.)

Dug: 0, yes! as long as I get my share it's all right!

[Enter Meg down stage.]

Meg: (Advances.) You are here, then?

Luke: (Looks abashed, she draws him forward.) Meg.

Meg: You have been drinking! Is it so you keep your promise? Come away -- this is no honest place. (Augustus signs.)

Meg: (After feeling in Luke's pocket.) You have spent the money I gave you for your breakfast, in drink.

Luke: I can always get a breakfast at one house or another. The servants always give me the broken victuals -- they all know Luke.

Meg: Come, then, and try and get a job to do; it will keep ye out of such dens as this.

Aug: (Aside to her.) Meg!

Meg: Lon'on mister!

Aug: (Aside.) Hush! there's a piece of roguery afoot, and they have got Luke into it.

Meg: Master? -- but they shan't -- I'll --

Aug: Hush! trust it to me. I'll nose it out, if I die for it. Take him away.

Meg: Come, Master Luke, come.

Hulks: (Aside to Luke.) Not a word about the revenge!

(Music. Hulks makes a gesture of significance, which Luke replies to cunningly, as he is led out by Meg.)

Meg: Come!

Luke: I'm a coming, Meg. I am coming.

(Exit Meg and Luke.)

Hulks: (Advancing with the paper which Luke has signed.) Now, I can meet the squire; and, once more afloat, I will secure my liberty. Here's the will which gives Luke his title, and here is my authority to act as his agent. Ho 'ho! I can take another tone with his baronetship!

Fan: (On the steps.) Dick, here's a swell in a cab, asking for the Rev. Obadiah Sleeky.

Hulks: 'T is he -- Sir Richard!

(The people about the room get up and go out. Hulks draws out a large pair of spectacles, which he puts on.)

Hulks: My umbrella! (Aside to Stag.) -- and, for fear of accident, I will leave the will with you. (Produces the will.)

Aug: (Interposing his hand.) I'll take the greatest care of it.

Hulks: No! you. Bill, you can defend it.

(Staggers takes the will and places it in his breast.)

Stag: With my life, Dick!

(Hulks has been pulling on a pair of old black gloves, takes umbrella.)

Hulks: If I am not here in two hours burn it.
(They exchange gestures of intelligence. Exit Hulks.)

Aug. Are they all gone?

Stag. Clear by this time.

Aug. And we are alone?

Stag. Quite.

Aug. No fear of interruption?

Stag. None.

Aug. A’hem—I say—how much do you weigh?

Stag. Seventeen stun six and a hounce.

Aug. 0, Lord! (Looks at himself.) Eight stun ten, just half; the odds are awful! (Measures Stag with his eye.) I think you are touched in the wind?

Stag. A trifle.

Aug. That will do—a’hem, Bill, I want that will.

Stag. What—what—what—

Aug. And I must have it!

Stag. He-he-he—will you?

Aug. I will!

Stag. Hold off! (Seizes Augustus, twinges him round, and throws him. Aug. springs up and seizes Stag.)

Stag. Fool! Are you mad?

Aug. Why, if you like—the will! (They struggle—after some trouble Stag again throws him.)

Aug. Who’s afraid? (Another struggle, in which Stag staggers somewhat wounded—they separate to breathe.)

Aug. You are blowing.

Stag. (Panting.) No, I a’n’t!

Aug. Time’s up! (They engage again.)

Stag. Curse the fellow! You will have it then?

Aug. If you can give it me. (They fight. Stag staggers at last act only on the defensive, and receiving several violent attacks, Augustus closes with him and throws him heavily—he kneels beside him, rips open his breast and tears out the will.)

Aug. Knocked off his perch. Ha! ha! I’ve got it, Meg! Meg! (As he is going off, up staircase, Stag rises and rushes for him, but, receiving a kick, falls.)

Scene closes.

Scene IV.—Same as before. (Scene II, Act V.) Enter Col. Vanguaed, L., meeting Arthur and Lucy, B.

Colonel. At last I’ve found you. Was there ever such a couple—up and out at eight in the morning!

Lucy. The influence of country habits!

Arthur. We indulge in a stroll through the Park before breakfast. But what has awakened you in the middle of the night?

Col. A message from Lady Vaughan.

Lucy. Rose?

Col. Richard is in some horrible position—detective police—escaped convicts—the whole Newgate calendar broke loose.

Lucy. Could it be the same wretches who threatened him four years ago?

Col. So she suspects; but Richard has no cause much longer to dread their revelations; he has voluntarily divested himself of the estate, of which I have received the rents, in trust, for the unknown legatee.

Arthur. No news of Luke?

Col. None in which any confidence can be placed. Sir Richard has, it appears, accompanied some officer to one of these nests of ruffians, where they have enticed him, in hopes of good intelligence.

Lucy. Poor Rose!

Col. She begs us to hasten to her.

Arthur. Let us order the carriage at once.

Lucy. Order the carriage! Ah! Arthur, how little you know of the helpless agony of a wife! She deems his life to be in danger; let us not lose an instant—let us run.
COL: Run! Run two miles! -- I tell you, Mrs. Apsley, soldiers are not accustomed to running. Leave it to me -- running is against standing orders. Run! -- a pretty general you would make!

ARTHUR: The prettiest general in the army list. Ah, Colonel, how the men would follow her, eh?

Col: Ah, you dog! Silence in the ranks! Whoo! -- (Winces) -- there's a screw of the gout -- forward! (Hails with his stick.) Holloa, cab! He sees me. (Takes an arm of each.) Threes about, come along! (Exeunt, L. H.)

Scene Last. -- A room in Sir Richard's house -- same as Scene L. Rose discovered writing. George, waiting.

Rose: The colonel was not up?

George: No, my lady! And Mr. and Mrs. Apsley were not at home.

Rose: You will send this note to Mr. Apsley directly. Is the messenger ready whom you said could take it?

George: He is always about the neighborhood; one of the servants has gone to seek him.

Rose: He is trustworthy, I hope?

George: Oh, yes, my lady! He is a poor old man, that I make bold to give our broken victuals to, and a glass of beer, now and then.

Rose: I do not wish you to encourage beggars.

George: He has not the wits to beg. He is not quite in his right mind, and it would be a charity to let him earn sixpence. (Ring inside.) Here he is, I daresay.

Rose: I hope this person has sense enough to understand this message; let him enter. I will myself give him directions. (Exit George, C.)

Rose: Past eight o'clock, and Richard still absent! This loneliness and terror preys upon me. (George shows in Luke, C.)

George: There is her ladyship -- stay -- clean your feet -- so -- that's the lady. (Exit.)

Luke: Ah! (Looks carelessly round and relapses in dulness.)

Rose: (Who is sitting with her back to Luke.) My good man, you know Portman Square? (Folds the letter.)

Luke: Eh! -- (Looks round with surprise and vacantly.)

Rose: You will take this letter there.

Luke: (Whispering.) The voice -- hush!

Rose: (Sealing the letter.) You can read the address if you forget. They tell me you are very poor; here is half-crown; and pray make haste!

(She rises and advances to Luke, who gazes on her fixedly as she hands him the money and the letter; they remain as if paralyzed.)

Rose: (in a whisper.) Father! Father!

Luke: (Looking at her as if she were a spirit.) Rose, my child! You come again! Yet, no -- why are you changed? Trifle not with a father's heart. You -- you are not -- you are not my child!

Rose: I am -- Father -- I am!

(Throws her arms about his neck.)
LUKE: My child! (Embraces her.) Yes, yes, here—come here, ha-ha! You will not leave me; you are mine! (He staggers.) Why—you go?—you—me—darkness—vision! (He falls upon the chair, senseless. Beside him Ross kneels at his feet.)

ROSE: Father! I am here! 'Tis your own Rose! Look on me. He does not hear me; the tears escape from his closed eyes. Be calm, father! I am once more worthy to kneel before you, and implore your blessing!

LUKE: (Reviving.) O, release me! (He raises his hand to his head.) A cloud lifts its darkness from my brain; but it is cold—very, very cold! Where—is this— (Looks around.)

ROSE: Father!

LUKE: Rose, ah! (Embracing her.) What have I dreamed? I fancied I had lost you—and visions of want and misery around me—but, no—you are here.

ROSE: Dearest father! I have found you. Would you know how wearily I have sought you?

LUKE: Sought me, and wherefore? (Looks around.) Where is this place?

ROSE: Do not fear—you are beneath my roof.

LUKE: Your roof! Yours! O! I remember—remember now. I read the past again—but it comes dimly over me, like a scene of childhood. I remember the Manor Hall—the letter—the damned Richard—and then—then—no—all is joined.

ROSE: Father, hear me!

LUKE: (Rises.) Am I beneath his roof, too?

ROSE: Yes!

LUKE: And this, then, is your home? This is the home of vision. Ah! You should see where I lie of a night!

ROSE: Father!

LUKE: And, from your door, I remember, I have taken alms. I have eaten your bread; his—his—and that is what made me mad. For, they said I was mad—and no wonder. My God!—no wonder.

ROSE: Mad! O, listen to me! Could you have seen my suffering—my countless tears—my prayers!

LUKE: You prayed, then, and sinned! You wept, and remained hypocrite! (Going.)

ROSE: Stay! I implore you!

LUKE: For what?—to meet him? Him whom I so loved! No, weep no more, child—hoard up your sorrow till age comes. O, beware of that! Grow not old; for, when the blood is chilled, and passions are swept away by time, like leaves from a withered tree, there remains the gaunt spectre of the past, pointing with a hundred weird fingers to the heaven to come. Treasure up your tears, child, for you will want them then! Farewell!

ROSE: (Clinging to him.) You shall not leave me! I will go with you! I am your child, father—your only child!

LUKE: I have no child!

(Enter Sir Richard and Hulks.)

SIR RICHARD: Luke! Luke here!

ROSE: Richard!

LUKE: Ay, Luke! You are not so ashamed as I am, Richard, to see Luke Fielding here beneath your roof!

RICHARD: No, not my roof, but yours—yours—which I am ready to cede to you, since it is your wish.

LUKE: My wish?

RICHARD: Your father, Rose, is, it appears, the unknown heir, for whom we have preserved the estate.
The will is in existence, and we are commanded to deliver up our tenure.

Luke: I, the heir to your estate? Commanded?

Richard: There is your agent.

Hulks: And this is your written authority.

(Enter Col. Vanguard, Lucy, and Apsley. Centre.)

Col: Here we are, Rose! Oh! Richard is back again, eh? (Sees Luke.) Luke!

Meg: (Outside.) Luke! Master Luke! (Enters.) Where be my master? Where be he?

Luke: Meg!

Richard: Colonel Vanguard, render up to Luke Fielding the faithful account you have kept of his estate.

Meg: His estate?

Col: Luke, can this be so? And is this your revenge? Revenge upon your own child!

Luke: Revenge!

Col: She is his wife—his wedded wife—needing but your forgiveness to restore her to all she was in happiness—and you—you thrust her from your own home!

Luke: I thrust her from me! Who—who says so? I deny my child! Rose—Rose—I care not what you are—you are my child! (Embraces her.)

Hulks: Come, I say, this is swindling—downright swindling of my client; you shall hear from me.

Sir R: Stay, sir! The will?

Hulks: What will?

Sir R: My father’s!

Hulks: Do you imagine that it exists? Who has seen it? No eyes but these! Pooh, fools! Let Luke Fielding make out his title without me, if he can?

Sir R: (Calls.) George! James! (Groom and a groom appear, a.d. Sir Richard points to Hulks.) Now, sir, will you yield up the document, or shall we invoke the police?

Hulks: Invoke the devil, if you like! You will find no document on me. What, did you think I would venture into this crib with all my valuables on my person? Not so green!

Sir R: Then you declare your own assertion false; the will does not exist?

Hulks: No!

(Enter Augustus—he has a black eye.)

Aug: Oh, yes it does! Here it is!

Hulks: Ha! Betrayed! Betrayed by Bill! Curse him! I might have guessed as much; he would never have defended it.

(Enter Staggers in custody with Lynx.)

Stag: Oh! Didn’t I though?

Lynx: Good morning, Mr. Hulks!

Hulks: Ah, Lynx! I hesitated this morning in the kid’s crib whether I shouldn't twist your neck. I was weak, and here's the consequences.

Lynx: Come, sir, come!

(Exeunt Lynx, Hulks, and Staggers. Colonel Vanguard and Lucy have been examining the will.)

Col: (To Aug.) You’re a brave lad, damme! I'll provide for you. I'll put a line into my will before I sleep.

Aug: You couldn't give us a little on account?

Col: Come, Luke, have you never a word for old Ralph?
